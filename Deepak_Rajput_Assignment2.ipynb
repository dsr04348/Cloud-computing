The country\\'s IT &amp; BPO sector, in which women account for 35% and 50% of the total workforce respectively, said they have periodically upped safety measures for women employees in the past five years to counter the unsafe environment outside office space.Given that the BPO industry predominantly functions during the night and a high percentage of women is employed, security and transport have become critical areas. IT lobby body Nasscom has already put in place a Nasscom BPO Code of Conduct that focuses on security during commute, transport and vendor selection, employee communication, and security within the premises. The code, for example, states that women employees must not sit in the front seat of the vehicle.Mumbai-headquartered BPO company Aegis has tweaked its human resource polices for women in the past year, such that now women employees across all levels can opt for a day shift instead of night shift. According to SM Gupta, global chief people officer at Aegis, about 90% of the company\\'s women workforce has opted for day shifts. The company has a workforce of around 24,000 employees of which 20% constitute women.\\\\\"For women employees travelling at night, strict and thorough background checks are done on the driver and security guards who accompany them home,\\\\\" said Gupta.HCL Technologies constantly monitors all employee cab services from its base stations. In case of any emergency, its SPOCs (single point of contacts) manning the base station can connect immediately with local police stations and patrolling units. Each employee also has on hand contact details of transport SPOCs, who can in turn mobilize necessary assistance in case of emergencies.\\\\\"All women employees have to call the transport desk to report safe arrival at home. In case they don\\'t , the transport desk calls up the employee at the estimated time of reaching home on her mobile or home number for confirmation.

And there are no signs that it would be free of sewage, as had been promised by the government, in the near future.The Intersection and Diversion units (ID) which were installed to divert incoming nalas or sewage lines, to treatments plants, have been rendered defunct owing to their labor intensive operation.The \\'Abatement of Pollution of River Musi\\' was a project sanctioned by the National River Conservation Directorate of Ministry of environment and forests in 2005. The project was split into two phases. Partly funded by the state government, its implementation was entrusted to the HMWSSB. In the first phase, four Sewerage Treatment Plants (STP), 35.36 km of conveying lines (to STPs) on the south and the north banks of the river, and 16 ID units were installed by the water board at a cost of Rs 400 crore.The ID units became functional in 2009 with the completion of the phase one of the project. Each one ofID unit collects water from a single nala flowing towards the river, detains wastes and de-silts the water before letting it flow into the intersectional pipelines that run along either side of the river. Each of the units require at least two men to remove the accumulated wastes and to allow effective functioning of the filtering mechanism at the units. If the units are not de-silted regularly, the nala water floods the units and makes a free run to the river, defeating all efforts to keep the latter clean.In April this year the contractor in charge of the units on the High Court to Salar Jung Museum stretch refused to continue work as the water board had not cleared the bills. TOI had reported the run off while drawing attention to the damage that the murky water had caused to the river and the promenades that were developed by the GHMC along the banks. But nothing has changed.This e stretch between the High Court and Salar Jung Museum has four units where sand bangs have been placed at the mouth of the units to prevent water from flowing out of the unit. However all efforts to contain nala water and divert it to the intersectional pipes have failed as de-silting is not taking place.When contacted, HMWSSB officials maintained that labour is being employed regularly to de-silt the units. But they failed to explain the run off. \\\\\"We are employing two men regularly to de-silt the units. It is not possible to keep up the activity all day long as it is labor intensive,\\\\\" said an official.According to experts unless the Water and Sewage Board takes up the pollution of the Musi river seriously, nothing is going to change. For instance, one of them said, the board should ensure deployment of necessary labour force and monitor the work regularly to get desired results. Or, it should change the de-silting and waste removal from manual to automated system immediately.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"new delhi\", \"code\": \"17750279\", \"title\": \"No bus was challaned for tinted film before rape\", \"text\": \"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police had never challaned any bus with tinted windows until the home ministry ordered them specifically to take action against such buses\\\\u00e2\\\\u20ac\\\\u201d72 hours after Nirbhaya was gang-raped in a chartered bus.

In the past one year, India has suffered 13,000 cyber incidents.The responsibility for the job has been vested in National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC), the nodal agency to coordinate cyber security operations for critical infrastructures across the country. NCIIPC has prepared a five-year plan to completely revamp and integrate the cyber security apparatus of all critical infrastructure such as power, transportation, water, telecommunication and defence.The agency, which is soon to be notified, further plans to set up sectoral Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) that will be connected to it. It will install sensors on all critical systems to give real-time information to its command and control centre about any cyber attack to formulate quick response.The government has also defined clear mandates for NCIIPC and CERT-IN, which is also engaged in cyber security of national infrastructure. NCIIPC will only look after absolutely critical sectors that have high threat perception coupled with greater dependence on computer and information technology (CIT), while other sectors will be with CERT-IN. These sectors (with NCIIPC) have been identified as energy (power, coal, oil and natural gas), transportation (railways and civil aviation), banking and finance , telecom, defence, space, law enforcement and security.Functioning under the aegis of National Technical Research Organization (NTRO), NCIIPC last Monday also organized the first national conference of chief information security officers (CISO) of critical sectors of the government.Sources said this is part of the step to first create awareness and ensure setting up of a robust security system in all critical government agencies at their own level. The task has been divided into five phases. Once agencies set up their security infrastructure, it will be connected to NCIIPC.\\\\\"There are plans to open a Cyber Security Operation Centre, a 24/7 control room for real-time information and response and a National Institute of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection for training of CISOs.

After winning all their league matches, PSB was expected to win against IOC in the semis.Punjab players, however, soon after entering the stadium realised that the contest would not be that easy for them. The 12th minute of the game brought surprise to them after IOC\\'s Gurjinder Singh sounded the board. With 0-1 in the match, PSB intensified their attacks. After 13 minutes, Sarvanjeet Singh brought them back in the match with his goal.Playing 1-1 in the match, PSB was again sent on the back-foot when India cap IOC\\'s Prabhjot Singh scored the goal. His goal came in the 31st minute of the first half that ended with the score 2-1 in the favour of IOC.PSB equalized in the 51st minute. But, the real-teaser for PSB came in the 53rd minute when they conceded an own goal making it 3-2 in the favour of IOC. IOC thus enter the final ousting the strongest title-contender from the tournament.In other semi-final, Air India had a stroll in the park against ONGC. With Vikram Pillay\\'s four goals, Air India made the going tough for the opponents in every department of the game. Two penalty strokes added woes to ONGC\\'s misery. Former India cap Arjun Halappa converted both strokes into goals. Sameer Dad also contributed with one goal.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"pune\", \"code\": \"17749320\", \"title\": \"Road rage: Cops clueless on attackers\", \"text\": \"PUNE: The Bhosari police are struggling to trace the suspects involved in an incident of road rage and robbery on the Bhosari-Alandi road on Saturday night.

Alec considers Tess his plaything, because of his higher socioeconomic status as well as the Victorian more that deemed a woman to be a man\\'s possession. He is confident of having his way with her and getting away with it, because he feels his gender and socioeconomic status render him untouchable. It is unfortunate that 21st century India remains stubbornly mired in such a Victorian mindset with regard to sex and gender which, needless to say, profoundly affects the way we approach rape.Because of the deplorable gang rape of a paramedic student in a Delhi bus, everyone now knows that Delhi is India\\'s rape capital. The situation, however, is not that much better in the rest of the nation. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, the maximum rape cases in 2011 (3,406) were reported in Madhya Pradesh. West Bengal came second with 2,363.Uttar Pradesh (2,042) and Rajasthan (1,800) had the dubious distinction of finishing third and fourth. Maharashtra followed with 1,701 reported cases, and Assam with 1,700. Therefore, it is apparent that rape is alive and well all over India.Since the Delhi rape was reported, a lot has been said in various media about tackling the problem. More policing, including more female policing, has been recommended to protect women from being raped. Tougher punishment for rape has been forwarded as a deterrent for future rapists. But once the dust settles, chances are, it will be business as usual. The key change has to happen in attitudes and the Victorian mindset we possess has shown remarkable resilience and continues to flourish. As far as the efficacy of female policing is concerned, well, recently policewomen were found to be just as unsympathetic to the women being assaulted in Gurgaon bars as their male counterparts. The persistence of such outdated tradition shows the extent to which education has failed as a vehicle to modernize the Indian mind. Unlike the Chinese, who chose to modernize at gunpoint, we put our faith in education.All current Indian education manages is teach someone the three Rs and, for the most part, does not even do a good job of that. As a result, for most Indians gender equality is somewhat like secularism. Something to spout rather than practice.South African writer Andre Brink\\'s virtuosic novel \\'A Chain of Voices\\' begins like this: \\'To know is not enough. One must try to understand as well.\\' It is advice that we as a society would do well to take to heart. If the revulsion caused by this deplorable incident is to bring about a lasting change, then it is essential to understand the dimension of the problem.It is only through understanding that we can move to amend the situation. Knowing without understanding is akin to the statutory warning on a cigarette packet that tells everyone that smoking is injurious to health. Its knowledge does not stop anyone from smoking.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"lucknow\", \"code\": \"17749565\", \"title\": \"Man booked for selling fake tickets\", \"text\": \"LUCKNOW: The news doing the rounds that Pakistani rock band will perform in the city turned out to be a hoax.

We got talking to different generations of three families from the community regarding how they celebrate Christmas.Carol and Markus Nunes, an elderly couple from Goa have been celebrating the festival for many years in the city. The scarcity of time these days has taken some sheen off the celebrations. Markus says, \\\\\"We used to have huge family gatherings in our times. We dined together, sang carols and distributed gifts and cakes but now technology and the internet has changed everything. You just order from here and the other receives.\\\\\"Markus\\'s son Randhir is more into charity. \\\\\"When I started celebrating Christmas on my own, I started with doing charity but I was always conscious about decorations and the crib. Now, we don\\'t get time to do even that.\\\\\"Randhir\\'s son Russell who is just 5 is fascinated by Santa and is excited about the gifts he\\'ll get. He loves to play Christmas games but he always helps his grandfather in decorating the Christmas tree. P J George, a resident of Sector 12, who belongs to Kerala says, \\\\\"In my youth, we used to have huge celebrations in our community. We used to start preparations for Christmas a week ago. Cakes and cookies were baked at home but now people find it easier to buy all they need from the market.\\\\\"Carol singing has also seen changes. The carol groups that visited Christian homes in the city now largely head to the colonies. \\\\\"I really miss those days when these groups visited each and every home,\\\\\" says Shoby George, son of P J George. The decorations that started a week ahead of the festival when his father was young are now delayed due to his and his wife, Leema\\'s busy schedules. Their children, Sheryl and Alisha love to take part in the celebrations.\\\\\"I like listening to my grandparent\\'s experiences,\\\\\" said Sheryl, a member of the third generation of the George family. Edwin Massih, who is basically from Gurdaspur, while talking about how they celebrated Xmas in the earlier days says, \\\\\"We decorated our house but it was all very simple then as we lived in a village. We used to travel 7 km to attend mass.\\\\\"Things have changed for his children\\'s generation, as they have a bonfire on Christmas eve, besides going for mass of course. \\\\\"I am more likely to share Christmas greetings on the internet with my friends ,\\\\\" said Ambrosia, Edwin\\'s daughter.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"kochi\", \"code\": \"17750214\", \"title\": \"Buy rail tickets from ATVMs\", \"text\": \"KOCHI: Here is a Christmas gift for rail passengers in the state.

Special commissioner of police (law and order) Dharmendra Kumar said, \\\\\"We have sufficient evidence to make a strong chargesheet against six accused persons.\\\\\"Officials said that it will be a \\'water-tight case\\'. More than 50 police officers have been working on collecting evidence for the past one week. Sources say they have already taken forensic evidence like fingerprints, nails and footprints from the bus DL1PB-0149, blood samples of the accused, samples from the clothes of the accused and objects like an iron rod kept inside the vehicle.

But the end result guarantees happiness to all who are a part of it,\\\\\" she added.Rules of the game are simple. A group of friends, relatives or siblings can play. Someone can play a moderator and ask all players to write their names on a piece of paper. The chits would then be placed in a bowl or hat. Each person will be asked to take one chit. Thereafter, he / she will have to gift a present to the person whose name was on the chit he / she drew out. Each one should try to gift something the person likes.The \\'secret\\' element lies in the fact that the name of the person who gave the gift is revealed only on New Year Day (seven days later). Larger the group, more interesting the game. They also recommend making a wish list behind the chits. An upper limit of how much can one can spend on a present will make it economical.The tradition, say certain people who play this game, owes its origin to a small town in England. It got popular and spread to other parts of United Kingdom. In fact, it became a rage in UK and the school authorities were forced to ban it for school children could not keep their hands off this game. A similar trend can be seen in city schools as well. Children now play the game secretly which has added to its \\'anonymity quotient\\'. \\\\\"Our teachers discourage the idea of exchanging gifts in school,\\\\\" said Nivedita Pant, who studies in a missionary school.Nivedita\\'s friend Neha added that most children were \\\\\"crazy about it\\\\\". \\\\\"We get weird gifts at times. And in the seven days of waiting to know the name of the person who brought the gift, we have a great time guessing \\'who is it?\\' We also enjoy flaunting our likes and dislikes (with the idea of suggesting a possible gift) among general conversations,\\\\\" explained Neha.Not just schools, Secret Santa is equally popular among office-goers. Fashion designer Pooja Shah shares that when she mooted the idea, her friends laughed at her. \\\\\"They told me I was being childish. But now, they all like it more than me,\\\\\" she said. Some elders have mature reasons to play the game.

The carol first saw the light of the day in the Catholic Church of St Nicholas at Oberndorf in Salzburg, Austria, on the German (Bavarian) border. Reflecting this in his book \\'Popular Music - A Historical and Thematic Analysis - A Thousand Pages of Songs\\' is author Michael Lobo. The book provides a history of the carol. There is a well-established story of how it came to be written. On the Christmas eve of 1818, the organ at the Church of St Nicholas broke down. The choir thus had to make do with a guitar, but despite this, the midnight mass was a resounding success because, in order to make up for the disappointment at losing their organ, the assistant parish priest and the organist sat down together to write a new carol, said Lobo, a Mangalorean, explaining the story to TOI. The organist, Franz Xaver Gruber, composed the music. The curate,Joseph Mohr wrote the lyrics. They are said to have done the work together in the few hours before the midnight mass and called the composition Stille Nacht. \\\\\"This pretty story may not be altogether true. There is no doubt that Gruber and Mohr composed the carol together, but they may have worked on it over a fairly long period,\\\\\" he said. For the first seven years of its existence, the hymn remained unknown outside Oberndorf. Then in 1825, it was taken to Tyrol in Austria by Karl Mauracher, an organ builder who was shown the hymn when he visited Oberndorf. In Tyrol, it came to the attention of a glove maker Joseph Strasser who was also the head of a singing family group and a student of folk music. Strasser paraded the carol at a Leipzig concert for Christmas 1832. Calling it a Tyrolean folk carol - and giving it the name Song of Heaven, this carol was actually sung by Strasser\\'s four children. Their performance so impressed the king and queen of Saxony that they were asked to sing it to the royal children. A music publisher named AR Friese, who was present at the concert proceeded to publish the carol (its first appearance in print) as one of four Tyrolean folk songs sung by the Strasser family. In the years that had elapsed since it was first composed by Gruber and Mohr, its melody had undergone a slight change, but nevertheless the original composers must have known at once that the carol was their own. The controversy was inevitable and the true composers actually had to take legal proceedings before they were able to establish their claim to authorship. Incidentally, Gruber and Mohr were themselves Austrian by birth, Lobo says.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"new delhi\", \"code\": \"17749038\", \"title\": \"Protests an eruption of accumulated anger, Meira Kumar says\", \"text\": \"NEW DELHI: Speaker Meira Kumar threw her lot behind the young protestors, calling the assault on Nirbhaya as a trigger for what was a long time coming.

The incident took place in Sector-V of Vikasnagar between 7.00 am and 8.00 am on Monday. Anamika, 48, was declared brought dead by doctors at trauma centre, while Niharika (27) died while doctors were attending to her. Nishant had a narrow escape, but the gunshot injured his ear badly. Surendra was admitted to the surgical emergency department at 1.00 p.m. and is battling for his life.What actually provoked Surendra to attack his family members is not known, though initial reports suggest that he took the extreme step to get rid of the psychological stress he was going through for the past few months. Singh\\'s wife was bed-ridden and experienced frequent attacks of epilepsy while his daughter who was single, also remained sick.The bank official\\'s son Nishant had completed his engineering from Pune and was preparing for MBA entrance exams. His daughter did not study beyond class XII and had been treated for psychological disorder, said the police, and added that the family was facing difficulty in finding a suitable match for her.Singh had been making rounds of doctors for over a decade, initially for his wife and subsequently for his daughter. Over the past few years Singh, according to reports, himself got drawn into severe depression and was taking medicines to overcome it.\\\\\"Singh was extremely disturbed making rounds of the doctors, as the condition of his family members was not improving,\\\\\" said RK Chaturvedi, SSP Lucknow who visited the family\\'s home on Monday morning.On Monday, Singh was the first one to wake up among his family members. He entered his wife\\'s bedroom carrying the firearm. He inserted the revolver inside Anamika\\'s ear and fired. Niharika who was sleeping next to her mother, was the next victim. By now, Nishant had woken up and ran towards his mother\\'s bedroom. Before he could have done anything to help his mother and sister, Surendra fired at him from close range. He somehow evaded the shot directed towards his head, but was injured by the gunshot. Meanwhile, Surendra walked to the hall, settled on the sofa peacefully and shot himself in a bid to end his life.Few minutes later, Nishant after coming to terms with the tragedy that struck his family, called up his maternal uncle and narrated the incident. Singh\\'s relatives who stay in Mahanagar and Vikasnagar rushed to his house. Almost at the same time, the police and ambulance arrived at the spot and took the injured to trauma centre at around 9.00 am.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"kochi\", \"code\": \"17750225\", \"title\": \"Visitors flock to Global Village\", \"text\": \"KOCHI: For those looking for Christmas fun and frolic, the Global Village, which is serving up a variety of entertainment programmes and food festivals at Bolghatty Island, is the place to be.On Xmas day, musician Charles Antony will sing in 12 foreign languages, dancers from Africa will perform to exotic songs and noted singer Franco and his team will belt out numbers in several Indian languages.The Thai pavilion has, meanwhile, become a huge crowd puller with artists and performers from Thailand creating colourful floral patterns on traditional umbrellas and transforming fruits into interesting forms and shapes.

I dug deep and discovered how railway officials hounded the staff to become TVI members. The bait was to pay Rs 15,500 membership fee in lieu of 5 nights and six-day vacation, with plane tickets. Shockingly, the plane never took off and crores were lost.The story landed up with me when a source saw a group of women slugging it out with a senior movement inspector (MI) in the DRM office premises. One of the irate women even tried to hurl a chappal at him for committing fraud. The MI had promised double returns in eight days by luring the poor women into the scheme.I found that over a dozen MIs and a young lady with the signalling department had virtually fleeced many employees by misusing official position and machinery. Many were made members even after the TVI shut shop in 2010. The scam grew like a weed difficult to root out.On October 26 evening, when I was filing the story, I talked to 2 MIs, who were masterminds. Both admitted to selling memberships to make a quick buck. My phone call pressed the panic button and the MIs involved, who chose the immoral way to become rich, huddled to stop the story.After a while, the MI himself called me. He said, \\\\\"Saheb, let\\'s talk when I return from Wardha. Till then you stop the story?\\\\\" Around 10 pm, the MI called me again to say, \\\\\"Saheb, I\\'ve reached Nagpur. Where can we meet?

This gratuitous question, hurled at the 23-year-old paramedical student, was more than just a prelude to her gang rape. The question betrayed a patriarchal mindset, which is as deep-rooted as it is wide-spread. From ministers to protestors, everybody is complicit in the gang rape because the patriarchy that contributed to it is sanctioned, not just by tradition but also by law.While suggesting measures for improving \\\\\"the safety of women\\\\\", the judicial commission that has been announced should therefore not limit itself to reviewing the provisions relating to sexual assault. It should take on the patriarchy embedded in various laws and rid the statute book of gender attitudes that don\\'t belong in the 21st century India.The conviction rate in rape cases has dropped from 46% to 26% in 40 years. The growing impunity enjoyed by rapists cannot be combated in isolation; it is the symptom of a larger systemic malaise. Here\\'s a checklist of gender iniquities in the laws, which the commission should address in order to take a holistic approach to the challenge of making women safer.* A logical corollary to the appointment of the commission would be for the government to withdraw the sexual assault Bill, which had been introduced in Parliament this very month. As a statement issued on Monday by \\\\\"women\\'s and progressive groups\\\\\" demanded, the Bill should not be passed in its current form because of \\\\\"its many serious loopholes and lacunae\\\\\". Though the trend in advanced countries is to make rape laws gender-neutral, these groups demanded that \\\\\"the definition of perpetrator be gender-specific and limited to men\\\\\". The commission would do well to examine the pros and cons of this proposal, from the viewpoint of the safety of women.* There is however no such uncertainty about the efficacy of another important amendment proposed by the civil society groups. Given the frequency of such cases in trouble-torn areas, they demanded the inclusion of rape by security forces as a specific category of aggravated sexual assault. Since the existing law anyway prescribes enhanced penalties for rapes committed by persons in a position of trust or authority (in police stations, jails, hospitals, etc), it would be appropriate for the commission to plug this loophole, which is responsible for spreading so much insecurity among women. Remember the dramatic picture of women stripping naked in Manipur with a banner daring the Army to rape them.* Although it was meant to update the rape law, the Bill has refrained from amending the anachronistic definition of marital rape in the Indian Penal Code 1860. This is despite the fact that at least 100 countries penalize non-consensual sex in which the perpetrator is the victim\\'s spouse. Such an offence is however recognized in India only when it is committed on an underage wife, that too when she is below 15. It would be a travesty of the ongoing public protests if the commission, regardless of this age restriction, does not denounce the sexist notion that a man is entitled to rape his wife.* The commission should also undo the gender anomaly in the adultery provision as it is one of the most glaring examples of the patriarchal prejudice underlying the statute book. Making no bones about treating the wife as a chattel (movable property), Section 497 IPC defines adultery in such a manner that only the cuckolded husband can be aggrieved by it. In the reverse situation, the wife is disallowed from initiating criminal proceedings against the husband on the charge of adultery. Though several expert reports have denounced this blatantly discriminatory provision, Parliament has so far not touched it. Nor has it acted on the alternative of turning adultery purely into a civil offence. The task is cut out for the commission, as the gender discrimination in adultery has to go, whether the offence remains criminal or turns civil.* Another insidious form of discrimination relates to the traditional conception of \\\\\"natural guardian\\\\\". Under the Hindu law, the natural guardian of a boy or unmarried girl is \\\\\"the father, and after him, the mother\\\\\". This led to bizarre situations like the Reserve Bank of India not allowing author Githa Hariharan, as brought out by a 1999 Supreme Court verdict, to buy a bond in the name of her minor son without the signature of her husband. The statutory presumption that the father was a more natural guardian than the mother has a bearing on custody battles too. The commission should not balk at recommending abolition of this gender inequity in everyday life.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"ahmedabad\", \"code\": \"17750724\", \"title\": \"No respite for men in khaki for 21 days\", \"text\": \"AHMEDABAD: While the entire government machinery worked night and day for a whole month on election duty, the drill period has not ended for the men in khaki just yet.

Found at various malls, shops, Christmas gatherings and churches, these people are security guards, labourers, sales employees and waiters. They bring smile on your faces, but most of the time, the face of their children is plunged in to darkness. Chandra Shekhar , a security guard, who is playing Santa Claus at a bakery shop on Ashok Marg said, \\\\\"The money earned from enacting Santa helps me in managing my winter budget.\\\\\" He added that before enacting as Santa, he was told about the legends on Santa and spirit behind the festival. He was also given training on how to say Ho Ho Ho and was asked to put a smile on his face for the whole day.However, there are some who play Santa for spreading joy and peace in the lives of others. Mala Mehra, a principal of a school has been enacting Santa Claus for past several years. She decided to play Santa Claus because in her school, most of the students belong to economically backward class and are unaware about Santa Claus. She along with her group of children visit old age homes on Christmas. Mehra said, \\\\\"The faces of old people light up when they receive gifts and sweets from me. They also sing carols with us.\\\\\" However, she enjoys most when she is in the company of kids. \\\\\"Every time, when I dress up as Santa Claus, the students of primary section ran out of their class. They jump on my shoulders thinking that a real Santa Claus has visited their school.\\\\\"Another Santa who is busy in bringing smile is Victor Solomon, a BCom student. \\\\\"For me, the best part of playing Santa is the love, which I get from children,\\\\\" said Solomon who is playing Santa for the last four years. \\\\\"After catching a glimpse of me, the children come up to me, hug me and get their pictures clicked. Sometimes, I offer them a ride on my car and they feel like as if they have taken a ride with Santa across the full moon on Santa\\'s sleigh.\\\\\" Similarly, Pradeep Gupta, a student, plays Santa as he likes acting. He said that for him Santa is a person who spread a message to be good and have faith on God. \\\\\"As I look thin, children ask me that if I am on dieting. They even ask me how to reduce weight,\\\\\" he laughs.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"bangalore\", \"code\": \"17751050\", \"title\": \"It is easier to get caste certificates\", \"text\": \"BANGALORE: Obtaining caste and income certificates \\\\u00e2\\\\u20ac\\\\u201d passports for thousands of aspirants to avail of government schemes or jobs \\\\u00e2\\\\u20ac\\\\u201d has become less cumbersome now.

The minimum temperature which was 4.4 degrees Celsius on Saturday and 5.2 degrees Celsius on Sunday rose to 9.2 degrees Celsius on Monday. However, fog in the morning delayed several flights. Almost all the trains were running 6-18 hours late. Road traffic was also badly hit. Muzaffarnagar recorded 3.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest minimum temperature in the state.Dense fog affected air and rail traffic in Rajasthan with the maximum impact being felt in Jaipur. Two Jaipur-bound flights were diverted while at least six early morning trains arrived late at Jaipur railway station. Mount Abu and Churu were the coldest areas recording a minimum temperature of 3.8 and 5.1 degree Celsius respectively.Uttarakhand hill districts bucked the trend and are experiencing clear sunshine. Met director Anand Sharma described weather conditions as pleasant for tourists coming to Mussoorie, Nainital, Mukteshwar, and Ranikhet to celebrate the New Year. Sachin Tendulkar came to Mussoorie with his family on Sunday.Despite clear skies, there is no respite from the bone-chilling cold across the plains of Punjab and Haryana. An aged person was found dead under a bus shelter near Red Cross office in Bhiwani town of Haryana. Extreme cold conditions also resulted in the death of a migrant labourer in Reckong Peo town of Kinnaur district in Himachal few days back. Budhnath belonged to Ghumla district of Jharkhand and was working as a labourer in Reckong Peo.In Himachal, the minimum temperature at high altitude areas is hovering between -1 to -10 degrees Celsius. Keylong town of Lahaul-Spiti district in HP is the coldest place in the state with minimum temperature hitting below -8 degrees Celsius. With \\'white Christmas\\' giving yet another miss to tourist towns of Himachal, the New Year eve is expected to get some snow as Shimla Met department has predicted change in weather conditions after December 26 with rain and snow predicted.Bihar was also hit by a cold wave and thick fog, disrupting rail and air services.

The Delhi Metro, which is fully air-conditioned, has a minimum fare of Rs 8 and the maximum can go up to Rs 30.The moderate hike won\\'t help the Kolkata Metro wipe out its revenue deficit but it will help lower the operating ratio from 300 Metro spends Rs 300 to earn Rs 100.The Metro fare structure has not been revised since 2002. Today, after the recent hike in bus fares, Metro is the cheapest form of public transport.\\\\\"The more services we introduce, the greater our revenue deficit. By March 2013, we plan to add 50 more services. Though the number of commuters has gone up, it hasn\\'t helped offset our deficit. Hopefully, the new fare structure will come into effect by end-January, 2013, and things will slowly improve. Even commuters want fares to be hiked,\\\\\" an official said.In October this year, soon after Trinamool Congress withdrew from the UPA and gave up the railway ministry, a committee was formed to decide a new fare structure. It submitted its proposal to the Railway Board and the Rail Tariff Authority (RTA) has already announced a possible hike in fares. While for other zones the increase is likely to be five to ten paise per km, additional calculations will have to be done in the Metro\\'s case as it traverses a small distance.\\\\\"We had expected the former railway minister to increase fares but he was clearly working under the instructions of Mamata Banerjee.

We just hope that politicians understand that Metro services can\\'t be provided at these rates anywhere in the world. We don\\'t want to earn a surplus but the deficit has to come down if the Railway Board is to clear more funds for the zone,\\\\\" the official added.According to another official, requests have been received from a large number of commuters to increase fares and provide better services. \\\\\"Trains are getting extremely crowded. We have been told by commuters that there are some miscreants who take advantage of this situation to misbehave with women.

The cops defended the decision saying the constable had fallen in the line of duty and deserved the honour.On the nature of Tomar\\'s injuries too, the police and doctors\\' versions did not quite square up. While the RML doctors told TOI that the constable had no \\\\\"external\\\\\" injuries and was treated only for cardiac arrest, the police chief said preliminary post mortem findings suggested \\\\\"internal\\\\\" injuries.Meanwhile, an AAP activist, Yogender, who claimed to have seen Tomar fall on Sunday, appeared on NDTV India and said the constable slumped to the ground on his own. Yogender said it was he who called an ambulance, which arrived 20 minutes later, and that Tomar initially got no help from his colleagues. Police dismissed this account, saying it had many discrepancies.Meanwhile, questions were raised on the police commissioner lending his shoulder to the constable\\'s bier, quite an unprecedented gesture for a policeman who lost his life in the line of duty. Some saw it as an attempt to deflect criticism the force has been facing after the gang rape incident.Commissioner Neeraj Kumar cited doctor\\'s findings to say that Tomar had internal injuries on his chest, neck and lower abdomen. \\\\\"Whatever injuries we are telling you about comes from what the RML doctors have told us,\\\\\" he said.\\\\\"We are adding the murder section based on the doctors\\' inputs,\\'\\' Taj Hasan, joint CP (central range), told the media.The real picture can only emerge once the post mortem report released after three days. The autopsy was conducted on Tuesday morning.Meanwhile, doctors at RML Hospital said Tomar didn\\'t have any external injuries. \\\\\"There were minor bruises on the chest and right wrist. He had suffered a cardiac arrest and was unconscious when brought to the hospital. We resuscitated him and had put him on ventilator support,\\'\\' said Dr T S Sidhu, medical superintendent, RML Hospital.Sources say that doctors had performed investigations like X-ray and ultrasound. \\\\\"He was being treated for cardiac problems. He had no other serious complication. He didn\\'t have any fractures,\\'\\' said Dr Sidhu.This was confirmed by Dr Jagdish Prasad, DGHS, Union health ministry, \\\\\"The MS had briefed me on Sunday about his condition. There were no external injuries. As he had suffered a heart attack, doctors at RML had to resuscitate him by giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\\\\\"Times ViewAnybody getting killed, whether policeman or protester, in the course of a stand-off between the two is a sad thing and must not be brushed aside as \\'collateral damage\\'. However, the government and the police must not use this tragic death as a convenient brush with which to tar protesters as a bunch of hooligans out simply to create trouble. The precise circumstances in which constable Tomar died remain a matter of speculation. If indeed some among the protesters deliberately trampled upon him leading to his death, they must be caught and punished. But a random crackdown on all protesters as revenge for his death or attempts to frame some people for it should not be tolerated.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"ahmedabad\", \"code\": \"17750629\", \"title\": \"Trust raped within the family\", \"text\": \"AHMEDABAD: In Gujarat, rapist is not a stranger lurking in the shadows to pounce on victims. He is most likely to be a family member, a distant relative, a neighbour or even an employer. Police records state that of the 439 rape cases reported in the state, 438 victims have told investigators that they knew the assailant! In just one case, the tormentor was a stranger.In past five years, the ratio of cases where the assailants were known to rape victims hovers at around 98 per cent. Even as rage over the brutal rape of a paramedical student in New Delhi has the country on the boil, the pattern of rapes put Gujarat in a different spotlight.Considered to be safe haven, Gujarat has reported more than a rape every day along with equal number of complaints related to molestation and eve-teasing. Data published in National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)\\'s annual publication \\'Crime In India\\' over past five years says that most vulnerable age group related to the sexual offences is 18 to 30 years with over 50 per cent of total cases registered in this category.Known people though do not even spare little girls who have not even started school. In Bapunagar recently, a four-year-old was raped by a 23-year-old man. He was her neighbour who lured the girl with games and chocolates and took her to his residence to play. He played with her life instead.\\\\\"It is a myth that Gujarat is safe for women. Here, danger lurks more in the homes and neighbourhoods as in majority rape cases we deal with, the girls identify the rapist. To my mind, this is a bigger breach of trust, as the known men cultivate trust in the girls and execute the crime with great planning in cold blood. Such friendly neighbours lure girls as young as four to eight years to an isolated spot and rape them\\\\\", says Manjula Pradeep of Navsarjan, who champions the cause of dalit rape victims.Pradeep is of a strong opinion that girls should be taught about possible sexual abuse at a young age and be trained in self-defense.Gaurang Jani, an Ahmedabad-based sociologist, deciphered the trend as fallout of power game between sexes and lack of education amongst the teens. \\\\\"Traditionally women are considered weaker sex and the most vulnerable are dependants and widows in our society who cannot go to anybody and complain. We have noticed a rather dangerous trend where the young girls fall prey to deceiving boys who lure them for casual relationship and exploit them,\\\\\" said Jani.He cited a recent example where a medical student in Rajkot was raped by a courier company employee pretending to be a medical student and after a couple of meetings raped her. \\\\\"While a daughter is educated by her mother once she enters her puberty about her sexuality, the same is not the case with boys. I believe that sex education and sensitization of teens can bring change in current mindset,\\\\\" he added.Talking about the trend, a senior police official said that the reason why most of the victims know the assailant is the failed relationships and sexual exploitation. \\\\\"We often see that the young couples fall in love and the boy cajoles the girl to develop a physical relationship. Hoping it to be consummated later in the future, the girl gives in and becomes victim of exploitation.

For, a corporation statuswould mean more funds for the civic body which is starved of funds.Former municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya recalled that the West Bengal Municipal Corporation Act was amended in 2006 to make provisions for the formation of the corporation in the Hills. \\\\\"Six years ago, we had made certain exceptions in the law to pave the way for the upgrade. The legal provisions were made, but couldn\\'t be executed because of resistance from the Hills body,\\\\\" he said.Bhattacharya added, \\\\\"Since the amendment has already been done, all the new board needs to do is pass a resolution and submit it to the state government. When a municipality is upgraded, it increases the status of the town that it is in charge of and creates more funds options. It also gains some administrative powers and the rights to make laws required to provide services to the area concerned.\\\\\"The West Bengal Municipal Corporation Act was amended in 2007, incorporating a special provision in Chapter II, clause 3 (iii), that empowers the government to notify separate set of norms for the Hills. Similar provision was made in the West Bengal Municipal Act that governs the formation of municipalities.The corporation status for Darjeeling municipality which was found in 1850 was first proposed a decade ago by the erstwhile Left Front government. But the proposal was shot down by the then Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council chairperson Subhas Ghisingh, who apparently didn\\'t want a mayor in the Hills lest his powers were usurped. His resistance had also sparked a rebellion within his party in 2001.On February 2, 2000, A K Dutta, secretary of municipal affairs department wrote (memo no 87/MA/)/C-4/1A-1/2000) that the state government was considering the proposal and a bill would be introduced soon. But the decision was deferred as the corporation issue took the Hills by storm and D K Pradhan, who was then the GNLF chairperson in the Darjeeling municipality and the brain behind the demand, was forced to resign from his civic post and eventually from the party. Apparently, Ghisingh didn\\'t want Darjeeling to get a mayor lest his own powers be usurped.However, a senior official of the state municipal affairs department said, \\\\\"Darjeeling is a tourist hotspot as well as India\\'s gateway, thanks to its proximity to Nepal and Bhutan . Now that peace has been established in the Hills and tourists are flocking like never before, the need of the hour is to provide better civic infrastructure.\\\\\"\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"aurangabad\", \"code\": \"17751510\", \"title\": \"Police seize 17,000 kg of rice meant for PDS\", \"text\": \"AURANGABAD: The Jawaharnagar police seized a truck carrying 17, 000 kg of rice, meant for public distribution system (PDS) but allegedly being transported to be sold in the black market in Chikhli district of Gujarat.Speaking to TOI, acting commissioner of police Arvind Chavariya said, \\\\\"On Saturday evening, we received a tip off that a 10 tyre truck in Gevrai of Beed district loaded with rice meant for PDS system is being smuggled to Gujarat.

The country\\'s IT &amp; BPO sector, in which women account for 35% and 50% of the total workforce respectively, said they have periodically upped safety measures for women employees in the past five years to counter the unsafe environment outside office space.Given that the BPO industry predominantly functions during the night and a high percentage of women is employed, security and transport have become critical areas. IT lobby body Nasscom has already put in place a Nasscom BPO Code of Conduct that focuses on security during commute, transport and vendor selection, employee communication, and security within the premises. The code, for example, states that women employees must not sit in the front seat of the vehicle.Mumbai-headquartered BPO company Aegis has tweaked its human resource polices for women in the past year, such that now women employees across all levels can opt for a day shift instead of night shift. According to SM Gupta, global chief people officer at Aegis, about 90% of the company\\'s women workforce has opted for day shifts. The company has a workforce of around 24,000 employees of which 20% constitute women.\\\\\"For women employees travelling at night, strict and thorough background checks are done on the driver and security guards who accompany them home,\\\\\" said Gupta.HCL Technologies constantly monitors all employee cab services from its base stations. In case of any emergency, its SPOCs (single point of contacts) manning the base station can connect immediately with local police stations and patrolling units. Each employee also has on hand contact details of transport SPOCs, who can in turn mobilize necessary assistance in case of emergencies.\\\\\"All women employees have to call the transport desk to report safe arrival at home. In case they don\\'t, the transport desk calls up the employee at the estimated time of reaching home on her mobile or home number for confirmation.

Presently, Mhada colonies get FSI of one. For instance, a plot measuring 1,000 sq ft can have a construction area of 1,000 sq ft. As per the new norm, Mhada colonies will have 2.5 FSI, which means construction area can be 2.5 times the land area.Mhada was established in 1977 with a view to extend fair housing opportunities to residents of the state.\\\\\"Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad have 15 Mhada colonies, which have 15,000 accommodations spread over 175 hectare land.

The state\\'s Economic Survey for 2010-11 says that while the Mumbai and Konkan boards have constructed 8,614 and 1,574 housing units, the Pune board could build only 329 dwellings - the lowest in the state - during the year.Pune BJP chief Vikas Mathkari said that the state government should not sit on such decisions and make people suffer. He demanded that affordable housing is the need of the hour in Pune to curb slum proliferation.According to a recent study on housing conducted for the Pune Municipal Corporation by NGO Mashal, there is a shortfall of nearly three lakh affordable housing units in the city. The number is likely to double in the next few years, considering the rate of migration, the study says. According to experts, ongoing efforts on housing for the economically weaker sections are piecemeal; a comprehensive policy is needed.The study states, \\\\\"The most stark and visible sign of the severe shortage of affordable housing that afflicts Pune, and other fast-growing cities across India, is the incessant growth in the number of slums. In Pune, it is estimated that 40.56% of the city\\'s population lives in slums at present, as compared to fewer than 20% 15 years ago. The housing stock periodically created over the years, by both the public and private sectors under labels like \\'economically weaker section\\' or \\'low income group\\' have proved to be grossly inadequate to provide for the growing squatter settlements and slums in urban areas.\\\\\"There is an acute shortage of affordable houses for urban poor in Pune city. Surveys suggest that around three lakh dwellings should be constructed to arrest further proliferation of slums. Land prices have skyrocketed and, in such a scenario, one of the viable alternatives is to redevelop 15 Mhada colonies spread over 175 hectares in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. It has been more than a year since the state government announced 2.5 FSI for reconstructing these colonies.

The ministry is planning to impose a slab on private airlines above which they would not be able to raise the air fares during a given period.Union civil aviation minister Ajit Singh told TOI here that a mechanism would be put in place that would not allow air fares to go beyond a fixed multiple of the minimum air fare during a given period. \\\\\"There have been times when air fares went out of bounds for people. That will be checked soon,\\\\\" Singh said while speaking to TOI.Air fares spiral up exponentially during the period of high demand. After Diwali rush , fairs have again started looking as people plan to visit their favourite destination to celebrate the New Year bash. For instance, the fare from Lucknow to Goa may range from Rs 12,000 to Rs 42,000. In fact, the travel has been structured in a way that different airlines come together to form a single package. The air fares of Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata-bound flights too are touching Rs 4,500; Rs 7,000 and Rs 5,500 per seat.For Patna-bound flights, air fares may be in the range of Rs 3,200 per seat but, a return ticket will cost you more than Rs 7,500 per seat in the year end.High air fares were observed also during Diwali when prices of air tickets shot through the roof, often touching figures six to seven times higher than the normal fare. \\\\\"The range between the lowest and the highest would be determined and fixed. The airlines won\\'t be allowed to go beyond that,\\\\\" the minister said.For instance, on normal days, the air ticket from Lucknow to Delhi costs anywhere in the range of Rs 3,000 per adult. However, during the Diwali season, the same ticket came at a cost of around Rs 12,000, which was beyond the reach of many. Singh said that this will be monitored consistently. The minister said that the air fares have been on the rise because of various reasons. \\\\\"The rising cost of fuel and the service tax have been one of the reasons. Besides this, the bucket system (where in a price slot is decided for a certain set of fliers booking tickets on a given point of time), is also to be blamed,\\\\\" he said.Tour operators insist that air fares have been very confusing. \\\\\"At times you come across a situation where in tickets bought later cost you cheaper than those bought earlier,\\\\\" said Prateek Hira, a city-based tour operator. \\\\\"There is an urgent need to have a pricing mechanism for air tickets.

The industry crossed the century mark in 2010, clocking 110 films, up from 84 in 2009.Significantly, at least 90% of them recovered the investment with around 15-20% rated very successful and 10% that did phenomenal business, says the just-released Deloitte report on media and entertainment industry in Bengal. According to sources, 20% of the movies were targeted at the urban multiplex audience, of which three-four did roaring business. The rest, comprising outright commercial films, many of them remakes of Hindi, Tamil or Telugu movies, also registered success in districts. Moreover, the revenue from DVDs has also increased several times with alternative movies finding many takers.The box office success has also seen investment peaking in the Bengali film industry to Rs 150 crore, around 20% higher than last year.What\\'s given the industry the biggest fillip is the emergence of new directors like Anik Dutta, Srijit Mukherjee, Moinak Bhowmick, Anjan Dutta, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury, Agnidev Chatterjee and Kaushik Ganguly, who are keen to experiment. Hence, while audiences would earlier look forward to barely two or three releases by directors like Rituparno Ghosh and Aparna Sen, now there are at least two significant releases each month with refreshingly different stories and treatment.\\\\\"The director or the star line-up doesn\\'t matter as much as it earlier did. Cine-goers still look forward to Rituparno and Aparna\\'s films but they have more choice on the platter now. And while Prosenjit Chatterjee has lost none of the star power, it no longer matters if the cast does not ring a bell because the new age Bengali films have interesting stories to tell and are well-mounted,\\\\\" said Deloitte director Sandip Biswas.This year, there has been a string of box office hits in alternative cinema - \\'Bhooter Bhabhishyat\\', \\'Hemlock Society\\', \\'Laptop\\', \\'Chitrangada\\' and \\'Muktodhara\\' - aimed at the urban and multiplex audience as well as mass commercial films like \\'Awara\\' and \\'Khokababu\\' that cater to rural and semi-urban audience. Interestingly, movies like \\'Ekti Tarar Khoje\\' and \\'Jadi Ekbar\\' have raked in more overseas than at home.\\\\\"The future of the Bengali film industry holds promise. It will be interesting to watch its evolution, as technology enables opportunities to monetize alternative channels like streaming content and narrow the window in reaching audience such as the international diaspora,\\\\\" said Biswas.Pinaki Shoukalin Ghosh, partner of Flipbook, believes technology is the most important catalyst. \\\\\"Due to technological advancement, the costs of the films are now more varied. This is leading to more \\'Indie\\' filmmakers, and therefore, more creative content and more experimental works,\\\\\" Ghosh said.Producers and exhibitors are also looking beyond Bengal. A few have already worked on co-productions with the Odiya film industry and released about half a dozen Bengali action films. This trend is expected to increase. \\\\\"The right partnerships can help the Bengali film industry grow manifold by tapping rural areas. These markets will help boost returns, leading to higher production budgets and thus start a virtuous cycle,\\\\\" said Eskay Movies director Himanshu Dhanuka.Bengali films have always had a market overseas. Now, the industry wants to give it a further impetus by pushing for simultaneous release in Kolkata and Dhaka, much like Hindi films open in Mumbai and Lahore . \\\\\"The Bengali film industry needs to better reach the audience in Bangladesh as we need to harness our similar languages and cultures to expand the market. This includes their diaspora which will be critical in facilitating a bigger overseas market for Bengali films,\\\\\" said filmmaker Goutam Ghose.Actor Prosenjit, too, feels it will be critical to embrace Bangladesh not just for its audience, but also for \\\\\"cross pollination of ideas and harnessing its talent\\\\\".\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"nagpur\", \"code\": \"17751137\", \"title\": \"It\\'s 6.6 degrees Celsius in Nagpur\", \"text\": \"NAGPUR: The chilliness in the city took on record-breaking levels on wee hours of Monday with the minimum temperature of Nagpur dipping to 6.6 degrees Celsius, around 6 degrees below normal.

Sathyamangalam Divisional Forest Officer N Sathish said surveys conducted by Wildlife Trust of India and Worldwide Fund in consultation with the forest department had confirmed that the tiger population in the area is between 18 and 25.\\\\\"Last year, there were 18 tigers. Based on the surveys done, we believe the tiger population within the sanctuary has increased to 25,\\\\\" he said. According to him, the number of tigers was fixed after identifying the individual tigers based on their unique coat pattern and DNA fingerprinting from scats. Apart from that, modern equipment including laser range finders was used for enumeration of tigers in the sanctuary. DNA analysis and camera trappings were also used for the conclusion, he said. The surveyors adopted line-transect direct count, carnivore sign survey, dung count and waterhole count systems to take stock of the tigers. According to Sathish, an itemized list of animals within the sanctuary would be released after merging data collected by surveys.\\\\\"The presence of tigers was confirmed in many areas. In Thengumarahada, Kettuvadi and Bijilatti, bodies of deer killed by tigers were found. Marks left by tigers on some trees were also documented. Cameras have been installed in various parts of the forest to capture their images,\\\\\" he said.According to Sathish, the enumerators found large herds of elephants inside the forest and their number count is around 800. The area is one of the largest havens for Asiatic elephants, he said. The surveyors also found cheetahs, jackals and bears inside the forest.\\\\\"A healthy prey base, strict vigil in forests, conservation efforts and reduction of cattle population in forest fringes has yielded positive results in Sathyamangalam,\\\\\" he said.\\\\\"Once it gets tiger reserve status, there would be total improvement in the wild animal count.

Apart from these two, the ministry had also mooted a tourism park and Aarogyadham at Madhurawada as well as a Wonders of the World theme park at Endada.According to sources, the surveyors who were in Vizag barely four days ago had visited the sites for the proposed projects and seemed to be happy with the sites allotted for most of the projects with the exception of the site at Mudasarlova and the one barely 1.5 kms from the Thotlakonda Buddhist heritage site at Kapuluppada. The two posed a problem as the former was allegedly in the catchment area of the Mudasarlova reservoir adjacent to it, while the other was to be provided access via the Thotlakonda road.According to sources, the surveyors realised that the 20-acre Mudasarlova site was completely wedged between Mudasarlova Park, the reservoir and Kambalakonda wildlife sanctuary and was uncomfortably close to the catchment, if not as alleged inside the catchment area.While sources in GVMC claimed that the land was allotted for such projects as it was not in the catchment zone, many concerned citizens believe that a large number of rules might have to be bent, if not broken, for some portions of this project to come true.As for the science and entertainment city project at Kapuluppada, sources said that the surveyors consulted members of Intach and the ASI officials on whether a road could be constructed leading to the proposed park but were understood to have received a defiant no for an answer. As per the ASI guidelines, paths leading to protected sites cannot be used for any other purpose and Intach sources pointed out that the Indian Navy had shelved a project behind Thotlakonda as they were denied access via the road leading to the heritage site.Sources observed that the same rule would hold true in case the government decides to grant access for the science and entertainment city which, if constructed 1.5 kms behind the Buddhist site as proposed, would have the potential to turn the road into a thoroughfare.The Rs150-crore international convention centre at Mudasarlova and the Rs 50 crore science and entertainment city near Thotlakonda were surveyed and found to be unsuitable location-wise.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"shimoga\", \"code\": \"17749449\", \"title\": \"Karnataka deputy CM raided, Rs 11 lakh found\", \"text\": \"SHIMOGA: In a huge embarrassment to the ruling BJP, Lokayukta raided properties of deputy chief minister and BJP state president K S Eshwarappa and seized Rs 10.9 lakh in cash, 1.9 kg of gold and 37 kg of silver on Monday.In all, searches were conducted at eight places, including his Bangalore and Shimoga residences, a cement dealership unit, two educational institutions and the house of his close aide N Somasekhar in Shimoga.A Shimoga court on December 15 ordered an investigation into a complaint filed by advocate B Vinod, who alleged that Eshwarappa, his son, Kanthesh K E, and daughter-in-law, Shalini, had amassed wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income.

Besides, he was at a high speed. In such a condition, the vehicle may lose control if the steering is moved slightly,\\\\\" said an official of the agency appointed by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) to examine the cause of the accident. The agency team visited the accident spot near Baur village on Monday morning. It will submit its report to the MSRDC.Human fault has always been the major cause of accidents on the Pune-Mumbai expressway. An official of IRB, an infrastructure company which maintains the expressway, said the spot is not accident-prone. Senior highway officials also said that more than 80% of mishaps, particularly on the expressway, have occurred because of human errors. Overspeeding and lane cutting at high speed being the major causes.Satish Walunjkar of the IRB patrolling team, who was the first to reach the spot, said, \\\\\"The truck was in the extreme right lane. It first dashed against the steel barricade, crossed the median, and came on to the Pune-Mumbai corridor. The WagonR was in the slow lane which is adjacent to the service road. The truck hit the car on its right side at a high speed. The driver of the car must have found himself helpless. If the median barricades were not there, the truck would have hit the car at a higher speed.\\\\\" Walunjkar said that another reason for the truck driver to spped was the fact that it was empty. \\\\\"The driver must have delivered goods in Mumbai and was returning to Pune. There is a possibility that he may not have had adequate rest and therefore felt sleepy.\\\\\"An MSRDC official said there was no reason for the truck driver to move right. \\\\\"This stretch of the highway near Baur is a straight road. The driver may have fallen asleep.

The persons travelling in the car were not at fault as they were moving safely in the left lane,\\\\\" said Pandole. If vehicles on the expressway move at a speed of 110 kmph and above, the crash barricades may not be able to withstand the impact in case of a crash, he added.A senior MSRDC official said the crash barricades have been installed as per the Indian Road Congress (IRC) norms. \\\\\"They help reduce the impact of the crash and are not meant for preventing vehicles coming on to the opposite corridor. The median is seven meters wide with plantation in between. Such a wide median does not exist on other highways. The truck driver crashed on to the barricade, crossed the seven meter wide median and sped on to the opposite corridor,\\\\\" said the official.The official accepted there is no continuous barricading along the median. \\\\\"The crash barricades have been put up only at places where they are necessary,\\\\\" he said.Chandmal Parmar, a road safety activist and one of the members of a sub-group which submitted its report to the Union government about road safety awareness, said that even if the crash barricades are as per IRC norms, it is necessary that stronger barricades be put up to prevent overspeeding vehicles from jumping onto the opposite lanes. He said that preventive measures are necessary and that there is an urgent need to keep a check on overspeeding. Parmar suggested speed rumblers be put up at places on the expressway.20 people died in similar accidents this yearAs many as 20 people have lost their lives this year on the Mumbai-Pune expressway stretch between Amrutanjan bridge and Kiwale (the Pune end of the expressway) because of overspeeding vehicles crossing the median and hitting vehicles in the opposite direction. Highway police officials said 65 people were seriously injured. At several places, the MSRDC has plugged the illegal median punctures from where vehicles crossed on from one corridor to the other. At some places, where the median punctures exist, the MSRDC has put up warning boards stating that they are for emergency situations and have to be used judiciously.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"None\", \"code\": \"17749319\", \"title\": \"\\'Let us promote religious tolerance\\'\", \"text\": \"The celebration of Christmas has become a noteworthy annual feature of our multi-religious and multicultural society. Indeed, the commemoration of the birth of Jesus is not limited to the Christian community. Christians believe that Jesus was born for the salvation of mankind. His life, message, values have a universal appeal. He laid down His life for the eternal happiness of mankind. Jesus steadfastly proclaimed the message of truth, love, justice, and peace without which it is impossible to live an orderly, meaningful, authentic and happy human life.In our pluralistic society religious tolerance is the foundation of stability, unity, progress and prosperity. We are mesmerized by progress in science, technology, medicine, economy and knowledge. But unless people of different religions live in peace and harmony and mutual respect and co-operation, all our hopes and aspirations will be futile and all our wonderful achievements will be fruitless.Discrimination, fundamentalism, fanaticism, hate and terrorism have brought about deep divisions, suspicions, distrust and fear among people. Religious intolerance obstructs and negates the dynamics of progress and development. Theories of clash of civilizations have been proposed because of the growing intolerance and violence.Unfortunately, the diabolical spirit of intolerance is entering into other areas and sectors of life. The recent barbaric assault on an innocent, young and promising medical student in Delhi is a heart-rending manifestation of intolerance of other fellow humans, particularly women.Christ\\'s message of truth, love and justice demands that all human beings should live their lives in freedom and dignity. Peace is not possible without respect for people\\'s basic rights, in particular, the right to live freely according to their conscience and according to their religious convictions and beliefs. Therefore, the tendencies and attempts to restrict and curtail religious rights and practices is a gross denial of the truth of human life and a denial of justice, without which peace cannot be attained. Jesus promoted freedom and liberty of the children of God as a foundation in society. Let people live according to their faith and traditions.As we commemorate the birth of Jesus and celebrate the festival of Christmas, let us resolve to promote the spirit of tolerance, particularly religious tolerance, for a liberated and a well-ordered society.I wish you all a Merry Christmas !- Thomas Dabre, Bishop of Poona\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"panaji\", \"code\": \"17751313\", \"title\": \"Morjim cleared of illegal beach beds\", \"text\": \"PANAJI: The tourism department on Monday cracked the whip on illegal deck beds at Morjim beach, seizing three truckloads of beach beds, chairs, umbrellas and hoardings.The raid by department officials with the help of a police team followed the STOI report on December 23, \\'Morjim beach beds keep turtles away\\'.

Thus rumours had been doing rounds that Mamata had convened the meeting with Trinamool leaders of Burdwan to discuss the recent clash at Durgapur\\'s Jai Balaji Industries and take steps towards restoring the town\\'s image as a flourishing industrial hub.Hardly a week ago, the GM (electrical) of Jai Balaji Industries was allegedly thrashed by Trinamool Congress trade union leader Asish Pramanik and his supporters in Bidhannagar. More recently, a section of Inttuc-backed supporters on Friday gheraoed a contractor at Durgapur Steel Plant, demanding employment of more workers affiliated to the union.The day also saw staffers of The Mission Hospital, backed by Inttuc, stage a dharna, threatening ceasework from January. But the district Inttuc president Prabhat Chatterjee said that the agitators were not affiliated to Trinamool.However, Pramanik - the main accused in the GM assault case - claimed that he has been recognized by Pradip Banerjee and Subrata Mukherjee.The CM, on the other hand, bypassed the embarrassing issue on Saturday. Instead, she hauled up the Asansol Municipal Corporation mayor Tapas Banerjee and Kulti Municipality chairman Ujjwal Chatterjee for no development work in their respective areas.

While Tapan Das, vice president of contractor union, claimed that they were given affiliation by Sen, Dilip Dhibar, owing allegiance to Chattopadhay, said that he and Prabhat Chatterjee were working together at present.It is this militant trade unionism that is stalling several factories from recruiting workers, though they are in dire need of contractor labourers.

The same seems to be the case with Mohanty and Panda. In this scenario, party national general secretary Dharmendra Pradhan and party state vice president Ashok Sahu have emerged as dark horses, party insiders added.Party sources said BJP\\'s national president Nitin Gadkari was scheduled to meet some senior party leaders from Odisha at 9 pm on Monday at his New Delhi residence to discuss on the next state party chief.

It was said that the corporation might fail to arrange its share of Rs 95 crore for it. However, Panzade said the required fund would be raised within time and deposited in a separate bank account by January 15, 2013.As per the agreement, the corporation had to deposit the amount in the account created under the head of \\'Water Payment Reserve Account\\'. \\\\\"It will be a reserved fund and will be utilized only in case of crisis,\\\\\" he said. The corporation has identified a property to mortgage for availing the loan from a public sector bank, he added.The corporation was in possession of Rs 143 crore received from the state government, therefore, there would not be any financial problem, he said. The state government had allotted the fund in 2010. The balance amount required for the project will be released after completion of 75% of the project.Apart from this, Panzade said that the SPV had already started the construction work of 2000 mm diameter pipeline at Jayakwadi dam. With the depleted water level at Jayakwadi dam, construction of 350 metres long platform for the pipeline in the dam became easy and hence its work started in July 2012, he added. A 42 kilometre long pipeline from Jayakwadi to Pharole and then to Nakshtrawadi is proposed under the project.Panzade said the agency would start a 24/7 call centre and six customer point of contact at each ward offices. Customers can contact the agency and log their complaints. The private agency will install water meters at all delivery points from its own funds and will recover it from the consumers in a span of five years. During the first year of the project, water bill will be generated on bi-monthly basis but in the second year monthly payments will be collected from the users.Consumers can pay bills online or give their bank accounts so that the amount can be automatically deducted at the time of bill generation. The agency will recover the outstanding water charges from customers from January 1.The total project cost is Rs 792.20 crore out of which the AMC will contribute Rs 399.53 crore while the special purpose vehicle will arrange the balance amount.

True. All females have, at some time, felt a chill of fear at the thought of rape. But what\\'s spilling on to the streets after a young woman\\'s rape is not fear, it\\'s a cumulative anger at the indifference to the continuing violation of women\\'s bodies and minds.There is an outcry for the death sentence . But, if punishment were a deterrent , there would have been no more murders. Prevention seems the answer. But how do we prevent rape and make the world a safer place for women? Specially when we live in a sick society, in which even children are raped, gang rapes are becoming the norm and rapists are rarely punished.It\\'s a society in which females are ogled and pawed on the roads, in places of study and work and subjected to lewd talk, all of which is called \\\\\"eve teasing\\\\\" . (Our language reflects our thinking . But teasing? For god\\'s sake, there is nothing playful about something that makes a female feel dirtied!) It\\'s a world in which porn is rampant , movies titillate with scantily-clad female bodies and even respectable newspapers and magazines carry pictures and \\\\\"researched\\\\\" stories about sex, to increase their circulation.Thankfully, most men are decent humans. And that men are fighting along with women in this agitation-turned-movement , making rape not a women\\'s issue, but a human issue, is a great step forward.And some things can be done. Like more policemen on the roads, better policing, brightly-lit streets, women-friendly police stations and policemen. Above all, prevention has to begin at home. By not killing our baby girls. By treating sons and daughters as equals. By teaching sons that females are not just bodies, but thinking, feeling human beings. By teaching daughters not to be afraid, but to be careful. Prevention requires a change in the law ---broadening the definition of rape, distinguishing between degrees, so that the rape of a child, gang rape or any rape that brutally dehumanizes a woman, gets the most severe punishment.Castration for repeated offenders is an option to explore. But can we trust our lawmakers, who have and continue to treat women\\'s issues as marginal and trivial, to do these things? Unlikely.

But it is also a time of looking into the true meaning of it, especially in our times 2012 years after the birth of Christ.The name Jesus means god with us. Today, we are in a world of search and research. Searching for truth for meaning in life and what more. People are doing research on god too. Where is god, how can we reach him, see him, touch him, if possible experience him, and speak to him. Man\\'s search for truth finds many ways of expression. Some of us are always in search of god, forgetting that god is with us. God is not beyond us, he is not behind, or above us. He lives with us, he is like one of us.God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son to us in the form of a child. Christmas is god\\'s love expressed to us in human form. Now we do not have to look around, and beyond us, but look to Jesus and we will find god.We also can find god in others, in our fellow beings, in humans who probably do not belong to our fold. Jesus Christ taught us the lesson of love, to love one another. He was born in a manger among the cows and animals. During his time, he loved the poor and had compassion for the downtrodden. Christmas should mean for us to care for the poor, and have a heart for them.When Jesus was born, the good news of the birth of Jesus was told to the shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. The Angel of the Lord told them, \\\\\"Be not afraid, for behold I bring you good news of great joy which will come for all the people...\\\\\" The shepherds went in haste and found Mary, Joseph and the child lying in the manger. We need an urgency to find the truth, and not to linger on.We also need to look and discover the power of love of god given into this world in the human form. We need not grope in darkness of ignorance, hatred, pride, anger and indifference. Jesus has an answer for all our queries, for he is The Light.

The urban planners recently sent a two-member team of engineers from the drainage department to China to inspect the state-of-the art Cyclic Activated Sludge Technology (C-Tech), an advanced sequential batch reactor process.Official sources said C-Tech is extensively used to treat domestic sewage and industrial effluents. A very high degree of treatment of waste water is achieved which makes it suitable for recycle and reuse at a very low cost using minimum space.The SMC has prepared a master plan for comprehensive sewerage system of more than 1,425km of sewers and nine sewage treatment works to serve not only the domestic and commercial but also the industrial developments till 2021.Waste water generated from all these developments is collected by a network of underground sewers and pumping stations and sent to sewage treatment works for physical and biological treatment to meet the parameters prescribed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) before discharging it into the nearest water course.After the massive devastation by the rainstorm in Beijing in July 2012, the city governments across China hastily ordered a thorough check on drainage systems and unveiled several plans for extensive upgrades.The Shanghai Drainage Administration announced to invest $1.63 billion (Rs 5,300 crore) to improve 28 drainage systems before 2015 by using advanced technology. \\\\\"We have already placed the order to install C-Tech system to treat sewage water in the city.

A 24-hour control room that integrates information from radio, video, web and phone services has been set up. In addition, all lost and found centres will be equipped with webcam facilities where photos of lost people will be telecast on screens set up across the mela area.

In an unprecedented development, all access roads to India Gate were closed on Monday and traffic diverted to already choking arteries like Mathura Road and Minto Road. Combined with the indefinite closure of nine Metro stations - in order to prevent the protesters from assembling - this lockdown in the heart of the city left commuters clueless. Going to the ministries, Connaught Place and beyond it became a feat for the day as traffic slowed down. Mediapersons were also not allowed near India Gate or Raisina Hill and were asked to go to Pragati Maidan.If a dense fog and Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s movement added to the chaos in the morning, the breakdown of a bus on the Moolchand flyover and closing down of one carriageway of the Kalindi Kunj flyover for repairs - Mathura Road took the maximum load of the traffic headed for DND - only compounded the problems. With chartered buses staying off the roads against \\\\\"police high-handedness\\'\\' and nine Metro stations off-limits, thousands struggled to reach their destinations while others were forced to return home.``By 6 am, our men had taken up strategic locations and section 144 imposed in the entire New Delhi area. This will continue indefinitely till we feel there is no threat to law and order,\\'\\' a top Delhi cop said. By the time day broke, 6000 men were guarding the entry points to India Gate with another 4000 elsewhere. Two different security rings were created with heaviest deployment in the inner ring.Office-goers and students were the most affected. Rajpath, including Central Vista, India Gate (C-Hexagon), Rafi Marg, Janpath and Man Singh Road were closed for traffic. Plying of buses on Mathura Road, between Neela Gombud Nizamuddin and W-point was stopped and traffic diverted on Ring Road. Similarly, the schedule of buses plying from Central Secretariat got disrupted.The worst affected stretches were Shantipath, Teen Murti, Willingdon Crescent, SP Marg, RML Hospital lane, Subramanium Bharti Marg, Lodhi Road, Windsor Place, Mandi House and Rail Bhawan. By evening, the Ashram intersection on Ring Road was choking. Dhaula Kuan at the other end was equally jammed with few access roads available for motorists. Commuters trying to reach CP from Pragati Maidan or Jorbagh were charged hefty sums by three-wheelers.In view of the incidents of the past two-three days, the venue of the meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Russian President Vladimar Putin had been shifted to the Race Course residence of the PM. Usually, such meetings are held in Hyderabad House which is close to India Gate, the scene of the protests. However, this same excuse was used in the morning to close the area. Police blocked Rafi Marg (from both sides) and one carriageway of Ashoka Road, Copernicus Marg and other stretches around India Gate.Employees had a tough time reaching their offices in Krishi Bhavan, Shastri Bhavan, Rail Bhavan and Nirman Bhavan as police did not allow them to cross Rajpath with even buses being diverted through longer routes. There was heavy barricading on Rafi Marg and Raisina Road and employees heading for South Block and North Block had to argue with policemen and show their identity cards to them. People heading for Connaught Place from south and east Delhi and vice versa faced severe problems in reaching their destinations.The public reaction was one of shock and anger. Even as Delhi Police updated its Facebook site on the blockade, angry citizens vent their anger questioning how police could dictate the right to movement of its citizens. The anger soon spilled on to the streets too. Niharika Mittal, a resident of Preet Vihar, said it took her half-an-hour to get to Barakhamba Road from the Sikandra Road intersection turning to Mandi House. ``It took close to 45 minutes to an hour just to reach the Mandi House roundabout from the Sikandra Road turn because traffic was crawling. Then the traffic was so heavy at the roundabout, it took another half-an-hour at least just to reach the Barakhamba Road turn. I even tried calling the traffic helpline to ask what routes should be avoided but couldn\\'t,\\\\\" she said.Aakhi Daftuar, a student, suggested the cops should stop thinking about the VIPs. ``When VIPs move, we are shut out. When we try to organize protests, we are again shut out. Are the public roads really meant for the common man?\\'\\' she asked after she got stuck near the ITO intersection for over an hour.Times viewShutting down the heart of a city cannot be standard operating procedure for a police dealing with protests. Unfortunately, in the case of Delhi, that seems to be becoming the case. True, the Delhi Police is groping for ways of dealing with a new kind of protests, one which is largely leaderless and spontaneous. So the old rules of engaging with the leaders of organised protest actions cannot be used in these situations. But that is no reason for such a panic-stricken response. The police may use Sunday evening\\'s violence to justify the shutdown, but the fact is that Metro stations had been ordered shut much before the violence happened. Indeed, the frustration at not being allowed to protest peacefully may have contributed to the violence, though it does not justify it.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"kochi\", \"code\": \"17750139\", \"title\": \"Lissy offers to prove Varkey is not her dad\", \"text\": \"KOCHI: Actress Lissy Priyadarshan has claimed before the Kerala high court that N D Varkey is not her father and that she is willing to prove it.The contention was raised by the actress in an appeal filed against a single bench\\'s order asking her to deposit Rs1.15 lakh towards maintenance arrears.Lissy has stated that Varkey is not her father and he was not known to her for the past 45 years.

APHB wants to make money out of the land meant for public amenities such as a community hall or a library.The board, which hardly cares to provide public amenities, is now hoping to raise about Rs 20 crore for the 3,433 square yard land at Balajinagar near Kukatpally. Another 3,242 sq yard land at Chintal would also go under the hammer. Though the upset price for the Balajinagar land is Rs 20,000 per sq yard, it is likely to fetch about Rs 50,000 per sq yard. On the other hand, the upset price for the land reserved for a school near MIG-II plot numbers 12 and 13 in Chintal is Rs 16,000 per sq yard. APHB officials expect the land to fetch at least Rs 25,000 per sq yard. APHB official said eight plots, four each in Balajinagar and Chintal, would be auctioned on January 9, 2013.Though officials claim that the board is clearly stating that the land earmarked for amenities should be used for the purpose it is meant for, the prime land would go into the hands of private owners.On the hand, residents claim instead of creating amenities like library, gym or post office, private parties might construct a building and rent it out for some super bazaar or a private bank. Similarly, the land meant for school would be rented out to a private school instead of giving the premises to a government or aided school or any other government educational institute.The APHB took up the development of the Balajinagar layout in the early 1990s and handed over 600 houses to different categories of allottees in 1995. As it is mandatory to earmark land for open spaces and amenities, the Board had left 3,433 sq yard land. Similarly, Chintal layout was developed with 400 plots of different sizes in 2001 and sold all of them except 17 plots. As 16 plots are in a cluster, the board is planning to construct apartment complexes. Another three plots, which are unsold at various places in the layout, along with 3,242 sq yard land for school would be put up for auction.\\\\\"Since APHB does not have funds to construct buildings for amenities, a decision was taken by the Board to auction it with a condition to use the land for public amenities,\\\\\" APHB executive engineer (North Division) K Mallikarjun Rao told TOI.Interestingly, APHB is scouting for leftover plots in layouts it had developed and plans to conduct auctions on monthly basis. The APHB had auctioned 14 plots in KPHB phases 4, 6, 9 and 15 last month and raised Rs 12 crore. It could garner Rs 51,333 per square yard against the upset price of Rs 40,000 for a 252-sq yard plot at Phase-9 of KPHB.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"jorhat\", \"code\": \"17749052\", \"title\": \"Rush in Jorhat markets\", \"text\": \"JORHAT: On Christmas eve, Jorhat town abuzz with activity.

For instance, the assistant director-cadre posts saw a big increase in horticulture department - from just 43, the number of AD-level posts increased to 396. As there was 509 total additional requirement of assistant directors, it was proposed to upgrade agricultural/horticultural officers by following common seniority based on their entry level posts.Of the 509 new posts, 325 came from agriculture department in what is called \\'deployed posts\\', with a condition that at the end of five years they can either continue in horticulture department or return to agriculture department.

And that too is expected to be ready by 2014. The fate of the remaining highway is unknown. Widening of the Mumbai-Pune and Pune-Satara highways reduced accidents by about 70%. Why then are the central and state governments going slow on the Goa highway?\\\\\"PWD officials cited lack of funds as the reason for the delay. Data compiled by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and state PWD shows that among the stretches of national highways that pass through Maharashtra, the Mumbai-Goa highway witnessed the most accidents and fatalities from 2006 to 2011. During the period, while 1,479 fatalities occurred on the Goa highway (476 km), the Dhule-Adilabad road (632 km) witnessed 1,471 deaths.State officials said over 60,000 vehicles used the highway every day till four years ago. But since then, the figure has dipped, as many motorists prefer to travel to Sindhudurg and Goa via the Pune expressway and Satara highway. The detour is long and takes up an extra hour, \\\\\"but is safer than the Goa route,\\\\\" said Rani Shergil, a Mumbaikar who regularly visits Tarkarli beach.According to a state official, several stretches of the Goa highway-particularly along the Kashedi ghat and Sangameshwar-are in poor condition. He noted that road elevation at curves is less than what is required. This leads to vehicles losing balance. \\\\\"Also, there are spots where one cannot see vehicles coming from the other direction since the surface is uneven,\\\\\" he added.\\\\\"Blind turns and village bikers make the road dangerous. Sukeli Ghat near Nagothane, Kashedi Ghat, Parshuram Ghat between Khed and Chiplun, Sangameshwar Road and the narrow road in Banda are risky stretches.

Under the pretext of financial crunch, the company moved the application for change in condition in payment of the amount. However, it also tried to establish that the company was liable to pay Rs 585 crore towards principal amount through installments, and not the interest of Rs 528 crore, the judge said while rejecting Essar\\'s plea to grant relief for nine months in paying Rs 15-crore monthly installment.In doing so, Justice Upadhyay differed from Justice M D Shah of the division bench, and that too at the initial stage of the case - while issuing the notice only. Justice Shah issued notice to the government, but Justice Upadhyay rejected Essar\\'s petition at this stage itself after terming it \\\\\"craftily drafted\\\\\" and \\\\\"mischievously timed\\\\\".\\\\\"I am conscious that normally, disagreement is not recorded in the matter of issuance of notice, however, in my view, even issuance of notice by this court, would get the approval of this Bench bn the ingenuity of the applicants to some extent, which I am not willing to do and therefore, I have thought it fit to write this dissenting order, rejecting the application today itself,\\\\\" Justice Upadhyay observed.In this case, Essar Steel Ltd was asked by the state government to pay Rs 1113.8 crore towards electricity duty that was due for 15 years. The company unsuccessfully tried before a single-judge bench, and then approached a division bench. In April 2010, the division bench stayed the authorities from recovering the amount on condition of the company paying Rs 15-crore installment every month.The company moved the court against earlier this month, when it was yet to pay Rs 75 crore towards the principal amount, requesting to modify the earlier order of payment. It claimed that due to financial crunch, it should be exempted the payment till November 2013, and then it would re-start the payment.The company sought to canvass that the earlier HC order had asked it to pay the principal amount in installments, and there was no order regarding payment of the interest amount. Justice Upadhyay was not ready to accept this. About interpretation of earlier order, he said that if the relief was granted to the company, it would amount to vacating the stay order granted by earlier bench.The judge wrote, \\\\\"I would prefer to err in favour of government exchequer, instead of committing an error in favour of the company, that too to the extent of about 600 crores of rupees.\\\\\" Justice Upadhyay further criticized the company for \\\\\"derailing the final hearing of its appeal on merits\\\\\" by tagging papers of the main case with this petition.

In this interview, Nushrat talks about the film, being a new comer in the industry and her chemistry with co star Kartik Tiwari.From Pyaar Ka Punchnama to Akaash Vani, you co-star with Kartik Tiwari again and the makers of the film are same too. How different will this film be from the former? In terms of look, it will be different. Both Kartik and I have been out of the spotlight for a whole year as the makers wanted people to forget the perception of us that they carried after Pyaar Ka Punchnama . So that way we both are different as Akaash and Vani are different from what we have done. The styling, the look of the film and even our characters have consciously been made different so that it looks fresh. I and Kartik look nice together.Post your chemistry in Pyaar Ka Punchnama, did you have to work harder on your chemistry to convince audiences that there is something fresh in this jodi? It\\'s a fight for every actor to surpass what they have done in their previous film especially when it is accepted hugely. Everyone loved PKP and it appealed to a mass. We have to surpass from what we did in that film so that that we are not doing the routine thing. At all times you have to be really aware, that\\'s all. For my character as Vani, nothing as Neha (from the film PKP) could have worked. Both the characters are from a different world, speak different languages and the love that Neha had with Rajat in PKP was all that she knew. Vani will have a different way of loving.Abhishek Pathak has gone on to say that it will be a romantic film on the likes of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Dil Toh Pagal Hain. Does that put pressure on you? In the history of cinema, such romantic films are either done with either absolute newcomers or relatively new actors. For example, take films like Ishq Vishq, Qayamat Se Qayamat and the likes; they have always worked with fresh characters. That\\'s why Luv sir chose to work with us. We had done a film earlier with him. I and Kartik still have that freshness so we were cast. The director (Luv Ranjan) has squeezed every emotion out foe m for this film.You\\'ve experimenting with different characters be it Love, Sex aur Dhoka, Pyaar Ka Punchnama or Akaash Vani. Does being versatile help in getting an actor noticed? I don\\'t know how this industry works. There is no formula. I believe that if I do good work something in the universe will fall right for it. This is all that I have in terms of work so it\\'s not about being versatile.In all your three films, you are cast opposite newcomers. Does it help to be paired opposite an established star? Of course it does! It boosts anyone\\'s career. You get that leverage and also get noticed. Eventually however your work speaks for you. People may know Nargis Fakhri or Ileana D\\'Cruz more than they know me and that\\'s because they are paired opposite big stars. Or then you have a filmmaker like Karan Johar who believes in the youth and who will ensure you are in the limelight even if he\\'s casting newcomers. But if you don\\'t have either, all you have to fall back on is your work. I don\\'t imagine myself being paired with anyone.A director you are looking forward to working with? At one point, I had a long list of people I wanted to work with. But over the last year, I would rather work with a director who wants to work with me rather than the other way round. If a director does not have faith in me that I can never play the role because I\\'ll be trying to prove myself all the time. I\\'ll be fighting a battle against myself.With no godfather in the industry, how do you ensure that you get the roles you are looking for? I have made every other person who has helped me my godfather. From my casting director to my line producer and especially Kumar Mangat. I cannot think of anyone who has put in so much time, effort and money on me, especially when they didn\\'t have to. They could have taken a bigger star cast. It\\'s been good this far.Being in the industry as a newcomer, what\\'s the most important lesson you have learnt or are learning? Never take anything for granted, no matter how small it may seem. Keeping your work above everything else is most important, it shouldn\\'t matter whether you are written about or not. Of course there are elements that go into making a star but it should not be your ultimate goal. If you don\\'t love what you are doing, there\\'s no point because it will never work.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"lucknow\", \"code\": \"17749533\", \"title\": \"Cathedral Church all set for a new look this Christmas\", \"text\": \"LUCKNOW: This year, visitors at St Joseph\\'s Cathedral church will get to see a different Christmas exhibition, with the church displaying the new colourful statues depicting the birth of Jesus Christ.

And while 26 public taps exist in the seven-member panchayat of about 4,000 people, no house has a connection.Locals allege that if they ask for a connection they are told by the PWD that there\\'s insufficient water for a domestic connection.Former ZP member Prakash Arjun Velip says, \\\\\"Ninety per cent of Morpirla\\'s residents are from the scheduled tribe communities of Gaonkars and Velips. They have to rely entirely on public tap water, which is released three times a day for only a few hours.\\\\\" Sarpanch Nilu B Gaonkar says, \\\\\"The panchayat gets income only from house tax and it is just Rs 17,000 per annum. But the water department has sent us a bill of Rs 12 lakh as charges for the public taps. This is a big burden on the panchayat. We have taken a resolution in the previous gram sabha to request the government to waive this bill. We have forwarded the resolution to the minister.\\\\\"He further pointed out that as the pipeline from Balli to Morpirla is just six inches in diametre diameter the pressure of water is insufficient to provide domestic tap connections.Calling the pipeline \\\\\"useless\\\\\", Velip explained that locals rely on a local spring for water from July to January. \\\\\"But from February it runs dry.\\\\\"A storage tank of 10,000-litre capacity stands on the top of the hill in the village. Spring water is collected in this tank and supplied to all the public taps by gravity. Another storage tank on a lower level collects water released by the PWD from the Selaulim dam.

He says the new pipeline from Selaulim to Betul, laid at a cost of Rs 17 crore, will benefit the people of Quepem constituency.\\\\\"The main reason in having this pipeline till Betul is to store water on Betul plateau as it is at the highest point. The government had acquired 40,000 sq m of land to construct storage tanks at Betul. Water will be distributed from these storage tanks to the four panchayat areas of Betul, Morpirla, Fatorpa and Balli. Even some parts of Salcete will be covered by these storage tanks,\\\\\" explained Kavlekar.Selaulim water which caters to residents even up to Vasco has a main junction at Ambaulim from where its branches supply different villages.

Rama Shanker Dubey, professor of Biochemistry at the BHU and former vice chancellor of Guru Ghasidas University, Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh), said that Malaviya envisioned this university to serve as a premier centre of world-knowledge for vigorous search of deeper quest and knowledge in all possible disciplines ranging from classical ancient Indian culture, philosophy, religion, humanities, arts to modern science, medicine, agriculture, engineering and technology. Malaviya was a strong proponent of science and engineering education in India. Prior to establishment of the BHU, he had realized the role of modern science in building a strong India.He was aware that science and technology could be the prime movers for the prosperity of resurgent India. He was of the view that India cannot regain its prosperity until the application of modern science becomes naturalized in the country. When Malaviya established the BHU in 1916, he had authored the prospectus of the university encompassing a comprehensive educational programme to impart the students the knowledge of Indian cultural heritage, ethics, and human values so that they do not get carried away by western civilization.At the same time, he served as a crusader to introduce the teachings of various disciplines of basic as well as modern science and engineering including agriculture and medicine so that large number of scientists, engineers and industrial leaders could be produced from the university capable of alleviating the sufferings of the masses by scientific solutions to the problems, by increasing agricultural and industrial production and creating wealth.According to Dubey, Malaviya always advocated for revival of Indian industries. With the donations received from Maharaja of Patiala and the Jodhpur Darbar, Malaviya initiated degree courses in Electrical and Mechanical engineering in BHU in July 1919, on the pattern of the courses run in British universities. He had realized the vast potential of mineral wealth of India and the deficiency of expertise to handle metals and mineral resources.Therefore Geology as a degree course was started in 1920 at BHU and degree courses in Mining and Metallurgy were started in the Engineering College in 1923. The first department of Industrial Chemistry in India was initiated in 1921 at BHU. Malaviya pioneered the beginning of the courses in Ceramics and Glass Technology in the Engineering College in 1924 where soaps, cosmetics, glass-wares and porcelain materials were manufactured.For the first time in India BSc and MSc degree courses in Pharmacy were initiated by Malaviya at BHU in the year 1935.Dr Vishwanath Pandey, Information and Public Relations Officer, BHU, said Malaviya\\'s life was replete with innumerable social causes and commitments, which tested and proved the character of the happy warrior in him.Social work started from the very beginning of Malaviya\\'s life, when as a youth in 1889 he founded the Bharati Bhavan Library, which is still serving the citizens of Allahabad. He also started a Boy Scout Unit in 1918 under the Prayag Seva Samiti to inculcate the spirit of service from a young age. Malaviyaji\\'s work for uplifting the oppressed classes was not due to any political motive, but more due to his own inner conscience and firm belief. In 1912, Malaviya encouraged his son Ramakant, to start the Yatri Seva Samiti, which later became Prayag Seva Samiti.The main objective was to extend help to the thousands of illiterate and helpless pilgrims. In January 1933, he persuaded the Sanatana dharma leaders to ameliorate the condition of the deprived classes. When the Harijan tour undertaken by Gandhiji ended on 29 July 1934 at Banaras, a meeting was held at the Central Hindu School grounds. Malaviya spoke in support of equal civil and religious rights to Harijans.According to Pandey, Malaviya was keen on educating the oppressed classes and the poor. His work started as early as in 1909 when he stressed the need for educating them. When BHU was established, he helped many poor, backward and needy persons to receive quality education there.In 1925, Malaviya had gone for the Mahasabha Conference to Patna and on the way back he addressed a huge gathering in Arrah. When he was getting into the car someone brought a young lad, Jagjivan Ram, and said that he had matriculated but had difficulty in pursuing further studies.Malaviya spontaneously told him to bring this boy with him to the university. Admitting him to the university, housing him in the hostel, waiving his fees and hostel expenses were all within the power of the vice chancellor, but what mattered most was the invitation to study along with his own son Govind.This was the humane side of Malaviya. He opened a separate Women\\'s College in the BHU campus in 1928, for undergraduate courses in the disciplines of the arts, sciences and humanities. He also encouraged women to take admission in other advanced courses.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"surat\", \"code\": \"17751582\", \"title\": \"Father\\\\u00e2\\\\u20ac\\\\u2122s friend rapes minor\", \"text\": \"SURAT: Even as protests rage unabated in Gujarat over the gruesome gang rape in New Delhi, at least three crimes against minor girls, one of the just four-years-old, were reported in south Gujarat in the last two days.In Udhna, a four-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her father\\'s 40-yaer-old friend on Saturday.

In 2011, police registered another 24,206 rape cases across India.Jaising said given the situation and the prevailing insensitive attitude, the judiciary and government must ensure that fast-track courts were presided by well-trained judges, who were sensitized to understand the plight of rape victims during trial and place due significance to her statements.She said use of scientific tools was an important component of criminal investigation of a rape case. However, not much effort had been made to set up forensic laboratories which could significantly help the police to fortify the evidence against rape accused.Jaising said the approach and attitude of public prosecutors was equally important in prosecuting rape accused. \\\\\"We need more women public prosecutors who can bring in a sea change in the presentation of evidence and the process of prosecuting the rape accused.

The area is called Sudasari and forms a part of the Desert National Park.It is for the first time in the past four decades that a GIB, also called godavan, has been poached during daytime. The forest department, taking a serious note of the incident, has started an investigation.Meanwhile, the police have identified two vehicles used in poaching - a Tata 207 and a Bolero -- in which the hunters took away the dead bird.The GIB is facing extinction and its hunting is illegal. The poaching comes at a time when the government is formulating schemes to protect it. The government has sent one such scheme to the Centre for approval.Sources pointed out that with the onset of winter, hunting of migratory birds begins at DNP but till now no action has been taken against any such elements.According to Khuhadi police station officer Kishore Singh, the two godavans were two kilometers away from the Sudasari area of the forest department. One vehicle that came from Khuhadi side spotted the godavans. They then called their friends through mobile phone. Later other poachers came in a Bolero and after parking their vehicle a little distance from the birds, fire at them.While one of the godavans died on the spot, the other managed to fly away. The poachers took the dead bird and left towards Khuhadi.

Once again, Kabul wants to \\\\\"collaborate\\\\\" with Pakistan, which has given safe haven to top leaders of the Taliban. A new Afghan \\\\\"roadmap\\\\\" to 2015 envisages that the Taliban and Hizb-e-Islami would become political parties by then and would participate in government in Kabul. Pakistan is an integral part of this process.While India has refrained from comment officially, there is much consternation within the government. With the US rushing for the exits in Afghanistan by 2014, India believes Washington will again be tempted to \\\\\"incentivize\\\\\" Pakistan with additional infusion of funds. Sources said India will continue to insist on maintaining the \\\\\"red lines\\' agreed for the reconciliation, i.e. a renunciation of al-Qaida , acceptance of the Afghan constitution etc.Fundamentally, India disagrees with the renewed breathless expectation that the Taliban could ever become a regular political party. \\\\\"They will overwhelm the government with their extreme ideology,\\\\\" Indian officials said under condition of anonymity. \\\\\"We have travelled down this road before, and it never leads to a happy place,\\\\\" they added gloomily.The roadmap says the first phase would be to secure support for the peace process, \\\\\"with a focus on securing the collaboration of Pakistan\\\\\".

Saudi Arabia will be the venue for the talks, it said. Pakistan will also be expected to give safe passage to Taliban leaders to travel to the talks.Indian officials said the concern here was that Pakistan would likely demand a reduction of India\\'s presence in Afghanistan in exchange.The third phase, beginning in the second half of 2013, will focus on the start of the peace talks themselves. This could end with giving the Taliban space in the forthcoming government by allowing them to participate in the next elections.Analysts say there are already some parties in Afghanistan\\'s political structure with a Taliban background, implying others could come down the same route. The fact is, the holdout Taliban leaders are not in Afghan government because they have a very different future in mind.By the first half of 2014, the High Peace Council expects to have a peace agreement signed. This will roughly coincide with the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and the next elections.If successful, it will allow the US to declare victory and get out of Afghanistan.

With residents saying that the guidelines framed by BMC do not take into account the existing cellphone towers, the civic body has written to the DoT seeking directions in cases that are in contradiction to the new policy.The new policy also specifies the safe distance between cellphone tower antennas and the surrounding residential buildings. For two antennas, the safe distance should be 35 m, for four antennas 45 m and for six it should be 55 m.Rajan Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India ( COAI), said that by sitting on so many proposals, BMC is denying citizens quality telecom service. \\\\\"BMC has framed this policy by misinterpreting the DoT guidelines and there are several mistakes in it,\\\\\" said Mathews.The policy also says that if 70 % occupants of a society do not want an already existing tower, BMC will not revalidate it after expiry of the approved period. The guidelines have included children homes to the list of buildings-schools , colleges and hospital buildings-where towers will not be allowed.BJP corporator Vinod Shelar, who played an important role in getting these new rules incorporated in the draft, said, \\\\\"With the number of towers increasing, it is BMC\\'s duty to frame stringent norms keeping in mind the hazards of radiations.\\\\\" BMC has also increased the deposit from Rs 5000 to Rs 50,000 to be taken from operators before giving them permission to erect cellphone towers.The new draft policyConsent of 70% occupants of a housing society or a tenanted building will be needed to instal a tower A structural stability certificate will be required from a structural engineer who has a licence from the BMC In case a building is more than 30 years old, fresh structural certificate will be required after every five years No tower on school, college, hospital and children home buildings Operators\\' deposit increased from Rs 5,000 to Rs 50,000.

The authenticity of spot/rapid kit test also came under scanner as a survey carried out by the PMC found that in 39% cases the spot tests gave false results.The PMC\\'s initiative to collate data from private hospitals was one of the reasons that more dengue cases were reported this year. Roping in private hospitals in its (PMC\\'s) reporting system for all kinds of communicable and non-communicable diseases has been the civic body\\'s major achievements in 2012. It is helping officials understand the city\\'s exact disease burden which was earlier assessed only on the basis of public healthcare system (cases reported at PMC-run and state-run Sassoon hospital).Besides, the city\\'s battle against influenza A H1N1 virus aka swine flu, which began in August 2009 continued to spill over with the virus infecting around 500 people and claiming 35 lives since April this year. However, unlike last year, when the virus triggered much panic, increased awareness and availability of vaccines helped citizens tide over the fears. Delay on part of patients to seek treatment continues to be one of the biggest causes for more swine flu deaths even in 2012.Among non-communicable diseases, diabetes remains the biggest burdens. Every multispecialty hospital in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad registers an average 70 new cases of diabetes every month. A decrease in the age group of patients with Type II diabetes and an over 30% rise in new cases are the concerns for doctors, policymakers and healthcare providers.After the Union government made it mandatory for private doctors and hospitals to notify cases of tuberculosis to local government/ semi-government authorities, the PMC started collating all the TB cases. Multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases were detected in Pune city after the referral laboratory opened in the Aundh chest hospital on February 10 this year. As a result, more cases of MDR-TB are coming on record which is now helping treatment.The save girl child movement, which picked up after the shaken state government started cracking down on sonography centres soon after the provisional figures of census 2011 came out, shows a 30-point dip in the child sex ratio from 913 in 2001 to 883 in 2011 - almost lost its steam in the second half of 2012. The cell formed at the civic body to make concerted focus on nabbing erring sonography clinics got disbanded and decentralised which according to activists was one of the reasons for low rate of inspection and raids resulting in low actions.Organ transplant is being vigorously carried out in many big cities, but it was, till recently, taking small steps in Pune. However, the city\\'s first liver transplant which was carried out a 54-year-old man at Ruby Hall Clinic on October 1, made the first bold step forward towards this direction. The transplant could become possible after a family of a 62-year-old man from Satara took the decision to donate his liver, kidneys and corneas after he was declared brain-dead on September 30.The state government revived the Pune-based Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC) at KEM Hospital, which had been functioning without any government funds since 2004, decided to grant a monthly budgetary fund of Rs 60,000 to it from this year onwards. The move is expected to provide impetus to human organ transplantation, particularly cadaver donations, and improve the city\\'s dismal cadaver donation count.The Times of India- IMRB Quality of Life survey released their report after carrying out a survey in eight mega cities including Pune. Hospitalisation facilities- the quality, affordability and value for money - put Pune second-last among the eight mega cities in the survey. The city may have the best of clinical and surgical expertise, but its citizens stand between a rock and a hard place - public healthcare is abysmal while private hospitals are out of the reach for a large section, the survey report says.The issue of early child marriages came as a jolt this year. The Pune Municipal Corporation\\'s (PMC) survey revealed a high incidence of early marriages in the city in 2012.

With bilateral relations having been snapped post 26/11/2008, this short series, which kicks off with the T20 at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Christmas Day, will be the first between the sides since 2007, when Pakistan came visiting.A near full house will greet the two teams as they finally get down to cricket after months of diplomacy managed to bring them together in a non-ICC event. When it comes to on-field stuff between the two sides, whose players have normally tended to get along quite well, it is usually how the Indian batting fares against Pakistan\\'s bowling that settles the contest.It doesn\\'t look any different this time around even if Dhoni said at the pre-match conference on Monday that \\'strength on paper\\' will not matter and it will be a simple case of which team plays better on the night. In an India-Pakistan match though, with all its attendant pressures, there can be a case of whichever team managing to play less worse, coming away with the right result.Yes, pressure will be the name of the game and no matter how much Hafeez may have stressed on the important of \\'good cricket\\' and how a win or loss is secondary, both teams know that neither country digests a loss against the other too well.There are of course a host of talents in either team but talent can only take you so far. Still, with both sides being fairly young, past history may not have that of much of a bearing. For the hosts, however, recent form -- they were outclassed by England in home Tests and held to a draw in a T20 series -- may be a more worrisome factor.Dhoni did say that close finishes in T20 cricket, such as the one in Mumbai last Saturday, don\\'t normally leave a team shattered, given the extremely short nature of the format and the shorter turnaround time between games.On the face of it, India\\'s problems may seem to lie with the inexperienced bowling attack. In reality, though, it is the batsmen on whom the onus must be put.Hafeez termed India as one of the most powerful line-ups in the world, if not the best. That the Indian batsmen have shown themselves to be fallible against pace and spin recently make matters worse.Add the fact that they will be up against proven performers such as Umar Gul, Sohail Tanvir, Saeed Ajmal and Shahid Afridi and it may even be a relief that it is only a T20 match on Tuesday.India\\'s saving grace could be Pakistan\\'s batting, which tends to disintegrate in unprecedented fashion.Times View: Cricket is our passion, let us cherish itOn both sides of the border, there are people who want this Indo-Pak series to be scrapped. To these people we would say that avenues for friendly engagements between people from both countries are few enough without our seeking to narrow them down even further.No reasonable person can quarrel with the proposition that it is in everybody\\'s interests if India and Pakistan can coexist peacefully.It must then follow that every chance of advancing the prospects of peace must be used. Cricket, like cinema and music, is something that the people of both countries are passionate about. Every time the two teams have met on the cricket field, the atmosphere has been great.

Social networking sites nowadays have become the new \\'Coffee House\\' where people hang out for hours and share almost every aspect of their lives. New acquaintances are made online by the minute and some turn into friendship. But with every \\'friend request\\' online, comes the threat of the unknown.Mahendra Limaye is a city-based lawyer who specializes in cyber crime and has assisted police in various cases. \\\\\"The biggest mistake girls make on social networking sites is that they do not apply rules of real world. Before you become friends with anyone in the real world you will have some reference point, but in the virtual world almost every friend request is accepted. This opens the door for possible abuse,\\\\\" he said.Some online profiles of girls publicly display their e-mail ID and mobile number that can be misused by perpetrators. \\\\\"In many cases, the accused comes up with the excuse that it was the girl who accepted the friend request and gave them the access to all details. They blatantly point out that girls should not accept requests if they are not comfortable talking to strangers,\\\\\" said Limaye.Sheetal Jham (name changed) is a teacher at a well known CBSE school and says students often use social networking sites as mud slinging fests. \\\\\"We had an incident where one boy posted a fake profile of a classmate. This was a result of their enmity and it became a big controversy at school. Then there are times when two kids will start arguing on a particular topic and soon it turns ugly. The topic of the debate is left aside as their comments turn personal, and the first one to complain is labelled as victim even though she may have started it,\\\\\" said Jham.While harassment can be done via phone and e-mail, some perpetrators choose social networking sites because the \\\\\"damage\\\\\" is bigger. Sometimes perpetrators tread the fine line between crime and practical joke but still manage to defile their target, without themselves getting in any legal trouble.Rekha Munje (name changed) is an undergraduate student whose best friend became a victim of online character assassination. \\\\\"After she rejected a classmate\\'s proposal, the perpetrator posted her picture online and tagged all of us. The picture was basically taken during our class picnic and my friend was casually posing with three male friends. The perpetrator commented on the photo saying \\'boys are better than girls\\', and my friend turned into a laughing stock,\\\\\" said Munje. The picture was genuine and the comment may sound harmless but since it implied that the girl was promiscuous, it created problems.Limaye advises that women must take utmost precaution on what part of their life they showcase online. \\\\\"Care has to be taken since anyone with bad intentions can misuse it. Social networking sites are just like the real world but with faceless interaction, hence precaution has to be taken,\\\\\" said Limaye.STAYING SAFE ONLINE* Never list your phone number on social networking sites* Tweak your online privacy settings so that your photos are viewed only by those whom you allow* Too personal or intimate photos should not be uploaded online as they can be misused* Approach the police if you are being harassed or are offended by anyone through phone calls or online* Never accept friend requests from total strangers. Even with those you might know, exercise your judgment.LEGAL PROVISIONS* Technology based crimes are covered under special act known as Information Technology Act.* The crimes which makes use of computers/mobiles/Internet or information technology where electronic data interchange happens are termed as cyber crimes.* The distinguishing features between traditional crimes under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and cyber crimes can be classified under various factors like tools used for committing crimes, methods of accessing the target, loss caused to the victim, damage to government property, damage to general morality standards and so on.* If found guilty, perpetrators of cyber crime can face jail.EXPERTSPEAKOnline world offers anonymity to perpetrators and they mask their real motives behind the virtual world\\'s mask. For the online perverts it is all about control and power over the victim. They get pleasure in harassing victims and seeing them suffer.

Barring instances of autorickshaw drivers charging more money, the district has not recorded major instances of women being molested and harassed in buses or autorickshaws.

Regional transport officer C Mallikarjuna had issued a public notice asking women to lodge a complaint to his office if they face any kind of inconvenience or harassment during their journey in bus or autos. Mallikarjuna told TOI that the office has not received a single complaint related to harassment or molestation of women in the past one year. \\\\\"The public transport system in Mangalore city is safer compared to metropolitan cities.

The fish will be used to biologically control the disease in rural areas. It is found to be very effective and is continuously distributed in the Coimbatore corporation limits, helping to curb the growth of mosquitoes. Consequently, the spread of dengue reported in the Coimbatore region is the least when compared to any other district in the state, he said.Damodaran said the fish would be bought from Mettur where it is bred and distributed to all PHCs. The fish will also be bred at the PHCs in a tub provided by the district public health centre, from where it would be distributed to health sub centres. The fish would also be released in water bodies and distributed to people visiting the centre for check up.Damodaran said they are self-perpetuating after initial establishment. They continue to reduce mosquito larvae for long time. The cost of introducing larvivorous fish is relatively lower than that of chemical. Larvivorous fish such as Gambusia prefer shallow water where mosquito larvae also breed.Gambusia fish can adapt to wide variations in temperature as well as to chemical and organic content of the water but does not tolerate very high organic pollution. The optimum temperature for reproduction ranges from 240C to 340C but the fish can survive at freezing temperatures. The fish frequent areas especially suitable for the mosquito larvae. It lives and multiplies in ponds stocked with larger fish provided the pond is shallow and has protective vegetation for refuge.A single full grown fish eats about 100 to 300 mosquito larvae per day. It can tolerate salinity.

However, when it comes to extending the relief, there are various discriminatory provisions in the state which prevents a girl from getting the help.Following the directions of the Supreme Court in 2011, the state government made some changes in category (i) or (iii) of Rule (4) of Relief Fund Rules that deal with rape victims and victims of other heinous crimes. However, compensation in such cases depends solely on the discretion of the chief minister. The state government though had provided relief to some rape victims, a majority of them is still running from pillar to post for the same. Also, under Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, a Dalit victim cannot get compensation if the rapist belongs to her own caste.In fact, if the victim is SC/ST, she would get Rs1.20 lakh but only if the accused belongs to a different caste. Take for example the plight of a 17-year-old Dalit girl, Damini (name changed). She was gangraped but denied compensation under the Act, as the persons who committed the offence belonged to her caste. Damini was gangraped in January 2012 in Jaipur.In another case, an eight-year-old girl was raped by a security guard in Jaipur in June last year. The social activists, who took up the case to help the victim get compensation, claimed that even though the incident took place in July last year, she has not been provided compensation yet. The victim belongs to OBC. Her case has been registered at Vaishali Nagar police station.\\\\\"In the first case, the victim did not get the compensation as she was unfortunately raped by her caste people while in the second case the victim did not get the compensation because she did not belong to SC/ST community,\\\\\" said social activist Renuka Pamecha.Pamecha said that she wrote to chief minister, chief secretary, home secretary and the collector seeking compensation from the chief minister\\'s relief fund but all her efforts went in vain. She said that all the rape victims should get compensation irrespective of their caste. \\\\\"Whoever commits the crime and whoever be the victim, the trauma which a victim suffers is the same. There are many rape victims who have not got any relief just because they belong to some other castes,\\\\\" Pamecha said.Centre for Dalit Rights functionary PL Mimroth said, \\\\\"There is a provision in the SC/ST Act that after an FIR is lodged and medical examination is conducted on the rape victim, the district administration should release Rs 60,000 as compensation immediately. Also, another Rs 60,000 will be provided to the victim after conviction as per the amended rules in December 2011.\\\\\"The issue of discrimination in extending compensation to rape victims had rocked the state assembly in 2007 as it was highlighted by the then Congress MLA Sanyam Lodha. He had alleged that from January 2004 to August 2005, 392 cases relating to rape of minor girls took place and that out of them, 377 victims did not get any relief or assistance. Just 13 were given relief ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000, while one victim was given Rs 3.95 lakh and another Rs 5 lakh. He demanded that all similar victims of rape should be given monetary relief. Talking to TOI, Lodha said: \\\\\"I took up the issue in 2006-07 in Vidhan Sabha. I moved the high court. The court had declared the discretion of chief minister in awarding variable compensation based on age of rape victims as unconstitutional.\\\\\"When the government changed in 2008, the government took the matter to the Supreme Court. The SC set aside the impugned order of the high court and dismissed the PIL filed by the respondent in the high court. But it observed, \\\\\"When there are no guidelines or when it is difficult to limit the discretion in a high functionary by guidelines, the authority should be careful in exercising discretionary power so to ensure that it does not give room for nepotism, favoritism or discrimination.\\\\\"The SC also observed that relief amount cannot be granted merely because the recipient happens to be the friend, supporter of the CM or belongs to his political party. The disbursement or payment to undeserving cases can be questioned.The court directed the state government, \\\\\"It may be appropriate to include a sub category relating to such victims (ghastly and heinous crime) under category (i) or (iii) of rule 4 of the relief fund rules.\\\\\"Though the government amended the rule, there are many rape victims who have not been provided any relief.Legal experts claimed that there is no law which makes compensation mandatory for all the rape victims.\\\\\"The SC/ST rape victim under the SC/ST Act is eligible for compensation. But if the rape victim is SC/ST and raped by SC/ST, then the case would be registered under general provisions of IPC,\\\\\" said senior advocate AK Jain.However, the state government has introduced a Rajasthan Victim Compensation Scheme, 2011. A notification was issued in January, 2012. Under the scheme, a victim of rape can get a compensation of maximum Rs 3 lakh. Jain said, \\\\\"There is no law in the country for giving compensation for a rape victim of general caste. Even under the newly launched Rajasthan government\\'s scheme for victims, it is not mandatory that the rape victim get the compensation.

Though George Bush\\'s administration launched the drone programme, Obama has, unquestioningly, continued it.But to illustrate the point about the loss of innocence, let\\'s look at a 2006 drone attack on a school in Bajaur Agency in the tribal areas bordering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The target was the principal of this madrasa \\\\u00e2\\\\u20ac\\\\u201d an alleged militant. The \\'collateral damage\\' \\\\u00e2\\\\u20ac\\\\u201d was 69 children. The elite of Pakistan may have paused briefly to mourn the losses over coffee table conversations but their anger would have been misplaced \\\\u00e2\\\\u20ac\\\\u201d they would be ranting about American imperialism but not for the lives of the children. As for Americans, they likely didn\\'t know about them.Why don\\'t we care about them? Even if you believe that every madrasa is a militant academy (which it isn\\'t), surely you can\\'t believe that every child is guilty. If anything, a concerted effort should be made to create a healthier environment for children. Surely the US government understands that a long-term development agenda would have been a better approach than \\\\\"smokin\\' \\'em out\\\\\".Why we don\\'t care, sadly, has something to do with class, a disease that ails us all. The reason we cared so much about the little children in Connecticut is probably because we relate to them, their parents and their lifestyles more than we do to a little six-year-old \\\\u00e2\\\\u20ac\\\\u201d now dead \\\\u00e2\\\\u20ac\\\\u201d playing cricket in the backyard of his madrassa. That child has no name. No face. No newspaper story. No reporter told us that when he was offered a sweet he always took an extra one for his little brother. We didn\\'t care to report, read or retweet precious moments in his life. In his op-ed, Monbiot refers to a September 2012 Stanford University-NYU report \\\\u00e2\\\\u20ac\\\\u201d Living Under Drones \\\\u00e2\\\\u20ac\\\\u201d on the social impact of this distanced US defence policy: Living Under Drones. Over the course of nine months and 130 interviews, researchers reveal the damaging psychological, social and environmental impacts of drones on those who live under their daily threat. One impact is a significant drop in number of school-going children, for fear of attacks.The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reports that at least 25% of the people killed in drone attacks are innocent civilians; 175 assuredly children.Part of the problem in how we perceive tragedy is how closely we associate with the protagonists of those stories. Perhaps it\\'s time for a re-think, not just in what issues we highlight, but also whose stories we choose to tell. There lies the bigger, unequal tragedy.The author is a Delhi based Pakistani journalist.\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"jabalpur\", \"code\": \"17751398\", \"title\": \"Rani Durgawati fort: Where women dread to tread\", \"text\": \"JABALPUR: Built atop a hillock and surrounded by lush green forest cover and a picturesque pond, Rani Durgawati fort occupies a pride of place in MP tourism brochures selling Jabalpur.

It was here that Doc Srini discovered in the 1990s that an ultraviolet excimer laser could etch living tissue in a precise manner with no thermal damage to the surrounding area.He named the phenomenon Ablative Photodecomposition (APD), and in the years since, ophthalmic surgeons have refined it to arrive at the corrective eye surgery generically called Lasik (which stands for Laser Assisted In-Situ Keratomileusis) to the benefit of millions of short-sighted people worldwide.\\\\\"The last decade has been quiet after the excitement of the 90s,\\\\\" Dr Srinivasan said in a telephone interview on Sunday with TNN. \\\\\"Then suddenly there was this call from the White House ...\\\\\"In his citation that honored eleven researchers with the Technology and Innovation medals, including for Dr Srinivasan\\'s teammates Dr Samuel Blum and Dr James Wynne, President Obama said \\\\\"They represent the ingenuity and imagination that has long made this nation great - and they remind us of the enormous impact a few good ideas can have when these creative qualities are unleashed in an entrepreneurial environment.\\\\\"Indeed, that is pretty much how it happened, although not in a way that turned Dr Srinivasan into the normative American multi-millionaire inventor.

The anger we saw spill out on the streets of Delhi was an organic act of intensely felt outrage. A spontaneous movement without any leaders or political affiliation, it is a sign that something has finally given way. The idea of living in constant fear, and having to make do with the platitudes of those in charge is no longer going to be met with stoic indifference. The reaction of the state reveals the poverty of its perspective. To lathicharge a largely non-violent protest several times and then to clamp down prohibitory orders to prevent the protests from taking place is an act of violent suppression, and comes from an ingrained instinct to convert the protest into the problem.And yet, when it comes to this specific incident, the quality of policing was not really the key problem. A bus that shows no sign of trouble at a reasonable hour at night has no reason to be stopped or inspected; without reasonable suspicion or any hint of trouble, the police cannot be expected to anticipate an incident of this kind. And while this was clearly not the time to gloat about it, the police action after the event has been swift. If the problem was confined to Delhi or was principally about increasing safety levels on buses, it would have been possible to take specific steps and improve the situation. The problem however, is a much larger one, and resides in a much more complex ecosystem.The call for death penalty or the demand for fast-track courts for such crimes needs to be understood in this context. From the perspective of citizens, the need to mirror the enormity of the problem with the severity of the punishment is easy to sympathise with. But it should be read as a sign of a larger disenchantment rather than responded to literally. It is easy to confuse the \\'bigness\\' of the solution with its effectiveness; in this case isolated actions will not solve a problem as deeply rooted as this one . The problem cannot be defined through the filter of rape alone; it is a much larger issue that involves the way in which women are viewed and responded to. The belief is that any woman on the streets is fair game; the only question seems to be whether that viewpoint stops at fantasising, passing lewd comments or actually taking any action, be it in the form of molestation or rape. The apparent harmlessness of \\'eve-teasing\\' that gets taken in one\\'s stride opens the door to an escalating spiral of violence. The kind of policing that is required is not retrospective, but which creates a general air of lawfulness where any infraction, however minor, is punished with a predictable degree of regularity.It is instructive that on the first night after the event, a television reporter reporting the incident was propositioned on camera by a group of car-borne youth who showed no fear of being filmed . The news channel tracked some of them down; the mother in one instance pleaded on behalf of the son, but the boys themselves seemed unfazed. It was as if they sensed that there would face no consequences of any kind from either from the administration or even from their peers. This is the greatest tragedy of it all - when such behaviour gets implicit social sanction for it means that we are dependent on the law alone, that society has withdrawn its mechanisms for keeping behaviour in check. If there are no social consequences for an illicit action, only legal hurdles, then the problem of morality turns into an opportunity of convenience.The problem cannot be divorced from the larger culture we are a part of. The films that we see, the celebrities we ogle, the thrall of consumerist bodies in slow motion, all crackling with pornographic electricity. The privileging of desire and its presentation as a self-justifying need helps create a climate when all that is desired becomes an object that can be bought through money or overwhelmed through power. The more women assert themselves as individuals, the greater the need to subdue them. The traditional anxiety about women gets amplified into need for domination and possession aided by a false sense of easy access that modern notions of consumerism foster.The democratisation of desire is accompanied by the legitimisation of lust. The neat and largely imagined distinction between the \\'criminal type\\' and the \\'law-abiding citizen\\' has blurred significantly. The sense that anyone can be the next murderer or rapist serves to create a widespread sense of insecurity. Conversely, the policing mechanism, far from becoming available to all, is retreating into becoming the private army of the powerful. An underlying sense of unease, of the fear that the powerful can not only get away with anything, but do so with impunity is palpable. The media plays the game at both ends, at one level creating the climate of desire while simultaneously engaging in shrill criticism after the event.As a result, a sense of anarchy and hysteria feed on each other. Debates are fierce but narrow, angry but unproductive. The system is too well entrenched to change, nor is it really pushed to. In asking for special measures to counter this problem, we are in effect acknowledging that the system as it exists cannot deliver. Without fundamental and systemic changes across the spectrum of the administration - Parliament, elections, bureaucracy, police and judiciary - and without engaging in a larger societal dialogue, a problem of this kind can no longer be tackled. This is not a particularly comforting thought, for it tells that no easy answers exist but the time has come to go beyond symbolic steps and demand wholesale change. It is time to look beyond the anger, beyond the apparent demands being made in this case and focus on pushing the system to transform itself - in its entirety.santoshdesai1963@indiatimes.com\", \"source\": \"toi\", \"date\": \"2012-12-25\"}\\n{\"city\": \"ludhiana\", \"code\": \"17750494\", \"title\": \"Wrath pours on web\", \"text\": \"LUDHIANA: Ludhianvis have taken the web route to vent their ire against the police lathicharge on those protesting against the gang rape of a 23-year-old girl, on Sunday.
